  {"id":"Absmeier2022","abstract":"Eukaryotic messenger RNA (mRNA) decay is generally initiated by removal of the 3ʹ polyadenosine (poly(A)) tail by the CCR4-NOT complex. Yeast Ccr4-Not binds and ubiquitinates ribosomes stalled on mRNAs with sub-optimal codons to trigger deadenylation and decay of the associated transcript. However, the mammalian ortholog of the E3 ubiquitin ligase subunit, CNOT4, is not a constitutive component of human CCR4-NOT. It therefore remains unclear how the mammalian deadenylation machinery targets stalled ribosomes. Here, we reconstitute translational stalling on non-optimal codons. We find that human CCR4-NOT recognizes translating mammalian ribosomes and is required for stable CNOT4 association. Our cryoEM structure reveals that the CNOT3 subunit detects slow translation and locks the L1 stalk of the ribosome in an open conformation to impede further elongation. Using crosslinking mass spectrometry, we show that CNOT4 and CNOT11 also bind in the vicinity of the E site. Overall, our work defines how CCR4-NOT enforces ribosomal stalling in response to low codon optimality.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Absmeier","given":"Eva"},{"family":"Chandrasekaran","given":"Viswanathan"},{"family":"O’Reilly","given":"Francis J"},{"family":"Stowell","given":"James AW"},{"family":"Rappsilber","given":"Juri"},{"family":"Passmore","given":"Lori A"}],"citation-key":"Absmeier2022","DOI":"10.1101/2022.07.24.501325","genre":"preprint","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,24]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Molecular Biology","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Specific recognition and ubiquitination of slow-moving ribosomes by human CCR4-NOT","type":"report","URL":"http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2022.07.24.501325"},

The symmetrical region can act as a center that coordinates amino acid polymerization by transferring intra-ribosomal signals between remote functional locations, as it connects, directly or through its extensions, the PTC, the three tRNA sites, the tunnel entrance, and the regions hosting elongation factors. Significant deviations from the overall symmetry stabilize the entire region and can be correlated with the shaping and guiding of the motion of the tRNA 3′-end from the A- into the P-site. The linkage between the elaborate PTC architecture and the spatial arrangements of the tRNA 3′-ends revealed the rotatory mechanism that integrates peptide bond formation, translocation within the PTC and nascent protein entrance into the exit tunnel. The positional catalysis exerted by the ribosome places the reactants in stereochemistry close to the intermediate state and facilitates the catalytic contribution of the P-site tRNA 2′-hydroxyl.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Agmon","given":"Ilana"},{"family":"Bashan","given":"Anat"},{"family":"Zarivach","given":"Raz"},{"family":"Yonath","given":"Ada"}],"citation-key":"Agmon2005","container-title":"Biological Chemistry","DOI":"10.1515/BC.2005.098","ISSN":"1437-4315","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2005,9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"833-844","publisher":"De Gruyter","section":"Biological Chemistry","source":"www.degruyter.com","title":"Symmetry at the active site of the ribosome: structural and functional implications","title-short":"Symmetry at the active site of the ribosome","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/BC.2005.098/html","volume":"386"},
  {"id":"Ahmed2020","abstract":"Variation in translation-elongation kinetics along a transcript’s coding sequence plays an important role in the maintenance of cellular protein homeostasis by regulating co-translational protein folding, localization, and maturation. Translation-elongation speed is influenced by molecular factors within mRNA and protein sequences. For example, the presence of proline in the ribosome’s P- or A-site slows down translation, but the effect of other pairs of amino acids, in the context of all 400 possible pairs, has not been characterized. Here, we study Saccharomyces cerevisiae using a combination of bioinformatics, mutational experiments, and evolutionary analyses, and show that many different pairs of amino acids and their associated tRNA molecules predictably and causally encode translation rate information when these pairs are present in the A- and P-sites of the ribosome independent of other factors known to influence translation speed including mRNA structure, wobble base pairing, tripeptide motifs, positively charged upstream nascent chain residues, and cognate tRNA concentration. The fast-translating pairs of amino acids that we identify are enriched four-fold relative to the slow-translating pairs across Saccharomyces cerevisiae’s proteome, while the slow-translating pairs are enriched downstream of domain boundaries. Thus, the chemical identity of amino acid pairs contributes to variability in translation rates, elongation kinetics are causally encoded in the primary structure of proteins, and signatures of evolutionary selection indicate their potential role in co-translational processes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Ahmed","given":"Nabeel"},{"family":"Friedrich","given":"Ulrike A."},{"family":"Sormanni","given":"Pietro"},{"family":"Ciryam","given":"Prajwal"},{"family":"Altman","given":"Naomi S."},{"family":"Bukau","given":"Bernd"},{"family":"Kramer","given":"Günter"},{"family":"O'Brien","given":"Edward P."}],"citation-key":"Ahmed2020","container-title":"Journal of Molecular Biology","container-title-short":"Journal of Molecular Biology","DOI":"10.1016/j.jmb.2020.10.030","ISSN":"0022-2836","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,3]]},"language":"en","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Pairs of amino acids at the P- and A-sites of the ribosome predictably and causally modulate translation-elongation rates","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283620306148"},

  {"id":"Amrani2004","abstract":"Nonsense-mediated messenger RNA decay (NMD) is triggered by premature translation termination, but the features distinguishing premature from normal termination are unknown. One model for NMD suggests that decay-inducing factors bound to mRNAs during early processing events are routinely removed by elongating ribosomes but remain associated with mRNAs when termination is premature, triggering rapid turnover. Recent experiments challenge this notion and suggest a model that posits that mRNA decay is activated by the intrinsically aberrant nature of premature termination. Here we use a primer extension inhibition (toeprinting) assay to delineate ribosome positioning and find that premature translation termination in yeast extracts is indeed aberrant. Ribosomes encountering premature UAA or UGA codons in the CAN1 mRNA fail to release and, instead, migrate to upstream AUGs. This anomaly depends on prior nonsense codon recognition and is eliminated in extracts derived from cells lacking the principal NMD factor, Upf1p, or by flanking the nonsense codon with a normal 3'-untranslated region (UTR). Tethered poly(A)-binding protein (Pab1p), used as a mimic of a normal 3'-UTR, recruits the termination factor Sup35p (eRF3) and stabilizes nonsense-containing mRNAs. These findings indicate that efficient termination and mRNA stability are dependent on a properly configured 3'-UTR.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,7,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Amrani","given":"Nadia"},{"family":"Ganesan","given":"Robin"},{"family":"Kervestin","given":"Stephanie"},{"family":"Mangus","given":"David A."},{"family":"Ghosh","given":"Shubhendu"},{"family":"Jacobson","given":"Allan"}],"citation-key":"Amrani2004","container-title":"Nature","container-title-short":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/nature03060","ISSN":"0028-0836","issue":"7013","issued":{"date-parts":[[2004,11,4]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2004 Nature Publishing Group","page":"112-118","source":"www.nature.com","title":"A faux 3′-UTR promotes aberrant termination and triggers nonsense- mediated mRNA decay","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v432/n7013/abs/nature03060.html","volume":"432"},

  {"id":"Anantharaman2006","abstract":"Using sensitive sequence profile searches and contextual information gleaned fromdomain architectures and predicted operons we identify a novel family of proteindomains with predicted ribonuclease activity. These domains are found in theeukaryotic proteins typified by the Nedd4-binding protein 1 and the bacterial YacPlikeproteins (Nedd4-BP1, YacP nucleases; NYN domains). We show that the NYNdomain shares a common protein fold with two other previously characterized groupsof nucleases, namely the PIN (PilT N-terminal) and FLAP/5’->3’ exonucleasesuperfamilies. We also show that all these proteins share a common set of 4 acidicconserved residues that are predicted to constitute their active site. Based on theconservation of the acidic residues and structural elements we suggest that that PINand NYN domains are likely to bind only a single metal ion, unlike the FLAP/5’->3’exonuclease superfamily, which binds two metal ions. We also present evidence thatthe other conserved residues shared by all these three domains are likely to playcritical roles in sensing the substrate and positioning the catalytic residues in theright conformation. Based on conserved gene neighborhoods we infer that thebacterial members are likely to be components of the processome/degradsome thatprocess tRNAs or ribosomal RNAs. Eukaryotic versions appear to have undergoneextensive functional diversification as suggested by the several distinctive multidomainarchitectures showing fusions with various other RNA-binding domains likeCCCH, PPR and KH domains. Interestingly, the eukaryotic NYN domains also showmultiple fusions to the UBA domain, an ubiquitin-binding adaptor domain. Thisobservation, together with the mono-ubiquitination of Nedd4-BP1 by the ubiquitinligase Nedd4 suggests that the NYN domain proteins of eukaryotes are regulated bymono-ubiquitination. Given the localization of Nedd4-BP1 to punctuate nuclearbodies, it is likely that they are parts of nuclear RNA-processing complexes that aredependent on mono-ubiquitination for their assembly.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Anantharaman","given":"Vivek"},{"family":"Aravind","given":"L."}],"citation-key":"Anantharaman2006","container-title":"RNA Biology","DOI":"10.4161/rna.3.1.2548","ISSN":"1547-6286","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006,1,1]]},"note":"_eprint: https://doi.org/10.4161/rna.3.1.2548","page":"18-27","publisher":"Taylor & Francis","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"The NYN Domains: Novel Predicted RNAses with a PIN Domain-Like Fold","title-short":"The NYN Domains","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.4161/rna.3.1.2548","volume":"3"},

Here we show that altered elongation kinetics on CAG expansions cause ribosome collisions that trigger ribotoxicity, proteotoxicity and maladaptive stress responses. CAG expansions cause an elongation rate conflict during HTT translation, when ribosomes rapidly decoding the optimal polyQ encounter a flanking slowly-decoded polyproline tract. The ensuing ribosome collisions lead to premature termination and release of aggregation-prone mHTT fragments. Due to the presence of a stress-responsive upstream open reading frame (uORF), HTT translation and aggregation are limited under normal conditions but enhanced under stress, seeding a vicious cycle of dysfunction. mHTT further exacerbates ribotoxicity by progressively sequestering eIF5A, a key regulator of translation elongation, polyamine metabolism and stress responses. eIF5A depletion in HD cells leads to widespread ribosome pausing on eIF5A-dependent sites, impaired cotranslational proteostasis, disrupted polyamine metabolism and maladaptive stress responses. Importantly, drugs that reduce translation initiation attenuate ribosome collisions and mitigate this escalating cascade of ribotoxic stress and dysfunction in HD.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Aviner","given":"Ranen"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Ting-Ting"},{"family":"Masto","given":"Vincent B."},{"family":"Gestaut","given":"Dan"},{"family":"Li","given":"Kathy H."},{"family":"Andino","given":"Raul"},{"family":"Frydman","given":"Judith"}],"citation-key":"Aviner2022","DOI":"10.1101/2022.05.04.490528","genre":"preprint","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,5]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Neuroscience","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Ribotoxic collisions on CAG expansions disrupt proteostasis and stress responses in Huntington’s Disease","type":"report","URL":"http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2022.05.04.490528"},
  {"id":"Baliga2021","abstract":"Apidaecin (Api), an unmodified 18-amino-acid-long proline-rich antibacterial peptide produced by bees, has been recently described as a specific inhibitor of translation termination. It invades the nascent peptide exit tunnel of the postrelease ribosome and traps the release factors preventing their recycling. Api binds in the exit tunnel in an extended conformation that matches the placement of a nascent polypeptide and establishes multiple contacts with ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and ribosomal proteins. Which of these interactions are critical for Api’s activity is unknown. We addressed this problem by analyzing the activity of all possible single-amino-acid substitutions of the Api variants synthesized in the bacterial cell. By conditionally expressing the engineered api gene, we generated Api directly in the bacterial cytosol, thereby bypassing the need for importing the peptide from the medium. The endogenously expressed Api, as well as its N-terminally truncated mutants, retained the antibacterial properties and the mechanism of action of the native peptide. Taking advantage of the Api expression system and next-generation sequencing, we mapped in one experiment all the single-amino-acid substitutions that preserve or alleviate the on-target activity of the Api mutants. Analysis of the inactivating mutations made it possible to define the pharmacophore of Api involved in critical interactions with the ribosome, transfer RNA (tRNA), and release factors. We also identified the Api segment that tolerates a variety of amino acid substitutions; alterations in this segment could be used to improve the pharmacological properties of the antibacterial peptide.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Baliga","given":"Chetana"},{"family":"Brown","given":"Tyler J."},{"family":"Florin","given":"Tanja"},{"family":"Colon","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Shah","given":"Vallari"},{"family":"Skowron","given":"Kornelia J."},{"family":"Kefi","given":"Amira"},{"family":"Szal","given":"Teresa"},{"family":"Klepacki","given":"Dorota"},{"family":"Moore","given":"Terry W."},{"family":"Vázquez-Laslop","given":"Nora"},{"family":"Mankin","given":"Alexander S."}],"citation-key":"Baliga2021","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.2026465118","ISBN":"9782026465117","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,9]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2021 . https://www.pnas.org/site/aboutpnas/licenses.xhtmlPublished under the PNAS license.","PMID":"33674389","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","section":"Biological Sciences","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"Charting the sequence-activity landscape of peptide inhibitors of translation termination","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/content/118/10/e2026465118","volume":"118"},

  {"id":"Bertolini2021","abstract":"Co-co assembly for oligomers\nMost of the human proteome forms oligomeric protein complexes, but how they assemble is poorly understood. Bertolini et al. used a ribosome-profiling approach to explore the existence of a cotranslational assembly mode based on the interaction of two nascent polypeptides, which they call the “co-co” assembly. Proteome-wide data were used to show whether, when, and how efficiently nascent complex subunits interact. The findings also show that human cells use co-co assembly to produce hundreds of different homo-oligomers. Co-co assembly involving ribosomes translating one messenger RNA may resolve the longstanding question of how cells prevent unwanted interactions between different protein isoforms to efficiently produce functional homo-oligomers.\nScience, this issue p. 57\nStructured Abstract\nINTRODUCTIONMost newly synthesized proteins associate into macromolecular complexes to become functional. Complex formation requires that subunits find each other in the crowded cellular environment while avoiding unspecific interactions and aggregation.Recent findings indicate that native complex formation is facilitated by coupling protein synthesis by ribosomes (translation) with folding and assembly. Studies analyzing formation of heteromeric complexes have elucidated the cotranslational engagement of nascent subunits by their fully translated, diffusing partner proteins (co-post assembly). We considered an alternative assembly mechanism that involves the interaction of two nascent subunits during their concurrent translation (co-co assembly) and thereby uncouples assembly from subunit diffusion. Provided that the interacting subunits are synthetized on one polysome, co-co assembly would increase the fidelity of homomer formation, prevent non-specific interactions with structural homologs and isoforms, and facilitate spatial and temporal coordination of the process. Whether cells employ co-co assembly as a general strategy for complex assembly, when and how efficiently nascent subunits interact, and what mechanisms are driving the process remain unclear.\nRATIONALEUpon co-co assembly, single translating ribosomes (monosomes) become connected via nascent proteins. These ribosome pairs (disomes) persist during nuclease treatment of cell lysates and protect mRNA fragments of 30 nucleotides in length (ribosome footprints). Our approach relies on the different sucrose gradient sedimentation properties of disomes and monosomes. Sequencing of footprints isolated from monosome and disome fractions identifies co-co assembly candidates across the nascent proteome as the mRNAs on which ribosomes shift from the monosome to the disome fraction during translation [disome selective profiling (DiSP)]. The position of the shift defines the co-co assembly onset and reveals exposed nascent protein segments that mediate dimerization.\nRESULTSWe employed DiSP to reveal comprehensive information about the co-co assembling proteome of two human cell lines and mechanistic principles of the assembly process. Interactions between nascent subunits are highly prevalent, involving thousands of candidate proteins from different cellular compartments. Co-co assembly is mostly employed to form homomeric rather than heteromeric complexes and is generally correlated with the exposure of N-terminal dimerization interfaces. Five conserved structural motifs are the main drivers of co-co assembly; among these, coiled coils are most prevalent, followed by BTB, BAR, SCAN, and RHD domains.Reconstitution in bacteria revealed that this process can occur independent of dedicated, eukaryote-specific assembly factors and minimally relies on the dimerization propensity of nascent protein N termini.Finally, we monitored the composition of lamin dimers inside human cells and showed that homodimer-forming subunits are templated by one transcript. This observation implies that cells may generally employ co-co assembly on a polysome to avoid mixing isoforms that share identical dimerization domains.\nCONCLUSIONOur study shows a previously unrecognized level of coupling of protein synthesis with complex assembly and provides direct evidence for the widespread occurrence of cotranslational interactions between nascent subunits in human cells. We propose that the polysome constitutes the platform for most co-co assembly interactions. This enhances the efficiency and accuracy of homomer formation and enables cells to independently evolve functionally diverse homomeric protein complexes that use recurrent oligomerization domains. <img class=\"fragment-image\" aria-describedby=\"F1-caption\" src=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/371/6524/57/F1.medium.gif\"/> Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Disome selective profiling reveals proteome-wide interactions between nascent proteins.Ribonuclease treatment of human cell lysates generates monosomes (M) and nascent protein–connected disomes (D) that are purified by sucrose gradient centrifugation. Ribosome-protected footprints from both fractions are deep-sequenced. A shift of elongating ribosomes from the monosome to the disome fraction indicates co-co assembly. The mRNA position of the shift reveals the dimerization motif that mediates assembly. Abs, absorbance; nt, nucleotides.\nAccurate assembly of newly synthesized proteins into functional oligomers is crucial for cell activity. In this study, we investigated whether direct interaction of two nascent proteins, emerging from nearby ribosomes (co-co assembly), constitutes a general mechanism for oligomer formation. We used proteome-wide screening to detect nascent chain–connected ribosome pairs and identified hundreds of homomer subunits that co-co assemble in human cells. Interactions are mediated by five major domain classes, among which N-terminal coiled coils are the most prevalent. We were able to reconstitute co-co assembly of nuclear lamin in Escherichia coli, demonstrating that dimer formation is independent of dedicated assembly machineries. Co-co assembly may thus represent an efficient way to limit protein aggregation risks posed by diffusion-driven assembly routes and ensure isoform-specific homomer formation.\nCo-co assembly during protein synthesis provides an efficient mechanism to limit aggregation risks during homomer formation.\nCo-co assembly during protein synthesis provides an efficient mechanism to limit aggregation risks during homomer formation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Bertolini","given":"Matilde"},{"family":"Fenzl","given":"Kai"},{"family":"Kats","given":"Ilia"},{"family":"Wruck","given":"Florian"},{"family":"Tippmann","given":"Frank"},{"family":"Schmitt","given":"Jaro"},{"family":"Auburger","given":"Josef Johannes"},{"family":"Tans","given":"Sander"},{"family":"Bukau","given":"Bernd"},{"family":"Kramer","given":"Günter"}],"citation-key":"Bertolini2021","container-title":"Science","DOI":"10.1126/science.abc7151","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","issue":"6524","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,1]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright © 2021, American Association for the Advancement of Science. https://www.sciencemag.org/about/science-licenses-journal-article-reuseThis is an article distributed under the terms of the Science Journals Default License.","page":"57-64","publisher":"American Association for the Advancement of Science","section":"Research Article","source":"science.sciencemag.org","title":"Interactions between nascent proteins translated by adjacent ribosomes drive homomer assembly","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/371/6524/57","volume":"371"},

The under-representation of alternating binary patterns in natural protein sequences, coupled with the observation that such patterns promote amyloid-like structures in de novo proteins, suggests that sequences of alternating polar and non-polar amino acids are inherently amyloidogenic and consequently have been disfavored by evolutionary selection.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Broome","given":"Bede M."},{"family":"Hecht","given":"Michael H."}],"citation-key":"Broome2000","container-title":"Journal of Molecular Biology","container-title-short":"Journal of Molecular Biology","DOI":"10.1006/jmbi.2000.3514","ISSN":"0022-2836","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2000,3,3]]},"language":"en","page":"961-968","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Nature disfavors sequences of alternating polar and non-polar amino acids: implications for amyloidogenesis11Edited by F.

  {"id":"Buschauer2020","abstract":"Coupling translation and mRNA decay\nGene expression requires messenger RNAs (mRNAs)—DNA-derived blueprints of genes—to be translated by protein-producing ribosomes. The levels of mRNAs are tightly regulated, in part by controlling their half-lives. In eukaryotic cells, mRNA half-life is largely linked to translational efficiency, but the mechanism underlying this link has remained elusive. Buschauer et al. used cryo–electron microscopy and RNA sequencing to show how a key regulator of mRNA degradation, the Ccr4-Not complex, monitors the ribosome during mRNA translation. They found that the Not5 subunit directly binds to a ribosomal site exposed specifically during inefficient decoding, thereby triggering mRNA degradation. Analysis of mutants revealed the importance of this sensing mechanism for mRNA homeostasis.\nScience, this issue p. eaay6912\nStructured Abstract\nINTRODUCTIONThe tightly controlled process of gene expression requires messenger RNAs (mRNAs), which represent DNA-derived blueprints for polypeptides, to be translated by the protein-producing machinery of the cell, the ribosomes. Therefore, protein levels depend largely on cellular mRNA levels, and the control of mRNA decay is one of the most critical processes for setting the overall level of gene expression. Half-lives of mRNAs vary greatly between different transcripts, and regulation of the mRNA decay rate is intimately connected to the elongation phase of mRNA translation. To that end, codon optimality has been established as a key parameter for determining mRNA half-life in multiple eukaryotic organisms. It has also been established that the timely decay of short-lived mRNAs enriched with nonoptimal codons requires the Ccr4-Not complex. Ccr4-Not is an essential protein complex, with its best understood role in mRNA degradation, where it serves as the major cytoplasmic 3′-poly(A)-tail deadenylase that initiates decay of most mRNAs. By deadenylation and subsequent activation of the mRNA decapping machinery, the Ccr4-Not complex renders mRNAs accessible to the major degrading exonucleases, such as Xrn1 on the 5′ end and the exosome on the 3′ end. The molecular mechanism underlying codon optimality monitoring and coordination with mRNA decay by the Ccr4-Not complex has remained elusive.\nRATIONALEBecause nonoptimal codons affect decoding kinetics of the ribosome and mRNA degradation occurs largely cotranslationally, it is highly plausible that codon optimality is directly monitored on the ribosome. In addition, a direct physical link between the participating Ccr4-Not complex and the ribosome has been suggested previously, and the Not4 subunit of the complex, an E3 ligase, ubiquitinates the eS7 protein of the 40S ribosomal subunit in yeast. Therefore, we set out to gain insights into the connection between the Ccr4-Not complex and the translation machinery in the context of mRNA homeostasis by combining cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM), ribosome profiling, and biochemical analysis.\nRESULTSWe used affinity-purified native Ccr4-Not–ribosome complexes from Saccharomyces cerevisiae for analysis by cryo-EM and found that recruitment of Ccr4-Not to the ribosome occurs via the Not5 subunit. The N terminus of Not5—in particular, a three α-helix bundle—interacted specifically with the ribosomal E-site, and deletion of the Not5 N-terminus resulted in the loss of stable ribosome association of the Ccr4-Not complex. However, ubiquitination of the small ribosomal subunit protein eS7 through the Not4 subunit still occurred. The Not5 interaction involved the ribosomal protein eS25 of the small subunit, in addition to transfer RNA (tRNA) and ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs). We found that Ccr4-Not interacts with both initiating and elongating ribosomes. In either case, Not5 engaged the E-site only when the ribosome adopted a distinct conformation lacking accommodated tRNA in the A-site, indicative of impaired decoding kinetics. Ribosome profiling revealed that low-optimality codons were enriched in the A-site in the Ccr4-Not–bound elongating ribosomes. This observation explained the low A-site tRNA occupancy observed with cryo-EM and suggested a link to codon optimality monitoring. Consistently, using mRNA stability assays, we found that loss of Not5 resulted in the inability of the mRNA degradation machinery to sense codon optimality. The observed dysregulation of mRNA half-life was detected upon Not5 deletion, Not5 N-terminal deletion, eS25 deletion, and loss of eS7 ubiquitination by Not4, which apparently serves as an upstream prerequisite for further Ccr4-Not activity on the ribosome. In addition, mRNA decapping was found to be impaired in these mutants, which confirmed that, in this pathway, Ccr4-Not triggers decapping downstream of optimality monitoring.\nCONCLUSIONOur analysis elucidates a direct physical link between the mRNA decay–mediating Ccr4-Not complex and the ribosome. Dependent on preceding ubiquitination of eS7 by the Not4 subunit, the Ccr4-Not complex binds (via the Not5 subunit) specifically to the ribosomal E-site when the A-site lacks tRNA because of slow decoding kinetics. This state of the ribosome occurs in the presence of nonoptimal codons in the A-site, which explains the shorter half-lives of transcripts enriched in nonoptimal codons. Thus, our findings provide mechanistic insights into the coordination of translation efficiency with mRNA stability through the Ccr4-Not complex. <img class=\"fragment-image\" aria-describedby=\"F1-caption\" src=\"https://science-sciencemag-org.offcampus.lib.washington.edu/content/sci/368/6488/eaay6912/F1.medium.gif\"/> Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Ccr4-Not couples translation efficiency to mRNA degradation.When ribosomes encounter nonoptimal codons, low decoding efficiency leads to an increased likelihood of dissociation of the E-site tRNA before the cognate tRNA is accommodated in the A-site. As a result, the ribosomal E-site adopts a specific conformation, which is recognized by the Ccr4-Not complex through the N-terminus of its Not5 subunit, eventually triggering mRNA degradation by Xrn1.\nControl of messenger RNA (mRNA) decay rate is intimately connected to translation elongation, but the spatial coordination of these events is poorly understood. The Ccr4-Not complex initiates mRNA decay through deadenylation and activation of decapping. We used a combination of cryo–electron microscopy, ribosome profiling, and mRNA stability assays to examine the recruitment of Ccr4-Not to the ribosome via specific interaction of the Not5 subunit with the ribosomal E-site in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This interaction occurred when the ribosome lacked accommodated A-site transfer RNA, indicative of low codon optimality. Loss of the interaction resulted in the inability of the mRNA degradation machinery to sense codon optimality. Our findings elucidate a physical link between the Ccr4-Not complex and the ribosome and provide mechanistic insight into the coupling of decoding efficiency with mRNA stability.\nA protein complex binds to ribosomes that lack bound tRNAs, thus connecting translation elongation problems and mRNA decay.\nA protein complex binds to ribosomes that lack bound tRNAs, thus connecting translation elongation problems and mRNA decay.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Buschauer","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Matsuo","given":"Yoshitaka"},{"family":"Sugiyama","given":"Takato"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Ying-Hsin"},{"family":"Alhusaini","given":"Najwa"},{"family":"Sweet","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Ikeuchi","given":"Ken"},{"family":"Cheng","given":"Jingdong"},{"family":"Matsuki","given":"Yasuko"},{"family":"Nobuta","given":"Risa"},{"family":"Gilmozzi","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Berninghausen","given":"Otto"},{"family":"Tesina","given":"Petr"},{"family":"Becker","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Coller","given":"Jeff"},{"family":"Inada","given":"Toshifumi"},{"family":"Beckmann","given":"Roland"}],"citation-key":"Buschauer2020","container-title":"Science","DOI":"10.1126/science.aay6912","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","issue":"6488","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,17]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright © 2020 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

  {"id":"Darnell2018","abstract":"Limitation for amino acids is thought to regulate translation in mammalian cells primarily by signaling through the kinases mTORC1 and GCN2. We find that a selective loss of arginine tRNA charging during limitation for arginine regulates translation through ribosome pausing at two of six arginine codons. Surprisingly, limitation for leucine, an essential and abundant amino acid in protein, results in little or no ribosome pausing. Chemical and genetic perturbation of mTORC1 and GCN2 signaling revealed that their robust response to leucine limitation prevents ribosome pausing, while an insufficient response to arginine limitation leads to loss of tRNA charging and ribosome pausing. Ribosome pausing decreases protein production and triggers premature ribosome termination without reducing mRNA levels. Together, our results suggest that amino acids that are not optimally sensed by the mTORC1 and GCN2 pathways still regulate translation through an evolutionarily conserved mechanism based on codon-specific ribosome pausing.","author":[{"family":"Darnell","given":"Alicia M."},{"family":"Subramaniam","given":"Arvind R."},{"family":"O'Shea","given":"Erin K."}],"citation-key":"Darnell2018","container-title":"Molecular Cell","container-title-short":"Mol Cell","DOI":"10.1016/j.molcel.2018.06.041","ISSN":"1097-4164","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,7,19]]},"language":"eng","page":"229-243.e11","PMCID":"PMC6516488","PMID":"30029003","source":"PubMed","title":"Translational Control through Differential Ribosome Pausing during Amino Acid Limitation in Mammalian Cells","type":"article-journal","volume":"71"},
  {"id":"deFreitasNascimento2018","abstract":"Selective transcription of individual protein coding genes does not occur in trypanosomes and the cellular copy number of each mRNA must be determined post-transcriptionally. Here, we provide evidence that codon choice directs the levels of constitutively expressed mRNAs. First, a novel codon usage metric, the gene expression codon adaptation index (geCAI), was developed that maximised the relationship between codon choice and the measured abundance for a transcriptome. Second, geCAI predictions of mRNA levels were tested using differently coded GFP transgenes and were successful over a 25-fold range, similar to the variation in endogenous mRNAs. Third, translation was necessary for the accelerated mRNA turnover resulting from codon choice. Thus, in trypanosomes, the information determining the levels of most mRNAs resides in the open reading frame and translation is required to access this information.\n          , \n            Genes are made up of DNA and contain the instructions to make molecules called proteins. This information is stored as a genetic code consisting of four bases: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T). The order of these bases and their different combinations serves as a blueprint for making thousands of different proteins and to assemble living cells.\n            Converting the information in the genes into proteins requires several steps. First, the code from the DNA needs to be transcribed into RNA and then processed to make messenger RNA, or mRNA for short, which in turn is translated into proteins. Cells decode mRNAs by reading the bases as groups of three, also called codons. Most codons specify an amino acid – the building blocks of proteins – but certain codons also mark the start and end point of a protein. This ensures that the mRNA is read in the correct ‘frame’ and the desired proteins are made.\n            Any cell contains thousands of different proteins and each protein has its own unique level. The mechanisms used to set the number of each different type of protein can operate at every point in the process. In many organisms, the number of times a gene is transcribed to make an mRNA, underpins differences in protein levels. Trypanosomes, for example, are parasites that cause a range of devastating diseases in humans and livestock. They lack the ability to set individual mRNA levels by regulating how often the gene is transcribed. This suggests that the expression of thousands of mRNAs is regulated by a common control mechanism later in the process ending in protein synthesis. However, until now, it was unclear what these mechanisms are.\n            Most amino acids are encoded by more than one codon. The different codons for one amino acid are not equivalent and using a different codon can lead the mRNA to yield more or less protein. Evolution acts on these differences between codons, and the ‘codon choice’ in any one mRNA represents the outcome of natural selection. Now, Nascimento, Kelly et al. found that codon choice directs both the levels of mRNAs and the level of translation.\n            For the experiments, a new metric that enables a prediction of the level of expression for each mRNA was created. This metric (known as the ‘gene expression codon adaptation index’ or geCAI for short) could relate the codon choice to mRNA levels. For example, mRNAs with a low index score had shorter half-lives, i.e., how long that mRNA remained in the cell before being broken down.\n            Nascimento, Kelly et al. confirmed this by measuring mRNA levels in specific genes tagged with distinguishable markers and revealed that the codon choice indeed dictated the rate at which an mRNA would be broken down. A separate study by Jeacock, Faria and Horn looked more closely at how codon choice contributes to the control of the copy number of proteins. However, genes and mRNAs involved in development could deviate from the levels predicted by the geCAI metric, which suggests that other mechanisms may be in place to control the stability these mRNAs.\n            The importance of codon choice in setting mRNA levels has now been demonstrated in several organisms, including yeast and trypanosomes, which suggests that this process is more widespread than previously realised.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Freitas Nascimento","given":"Janaina","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Kelly","given":"Steven"},{"family":"Sunter","given":"Jack"},{"family":"Carrington","given":"Mark"}],"citation-key":"deFreitasNascimento2018","container-title":"eLife","DOI":"10.7554/eLife.32467","ISSN":"2050-084X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,3,15]]},"language":"en","page":"e32467","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Codon choice directs constitutive mRNA levels in trypanosomes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://elifesciences.org/articles/32467","volume":"7"},

L4 and L22 have elongated loops whose tips converge in the peptide exit tunnel near the macrolide-binding site, and resistance mutations typically affect residues within these loops. Here, we used bacteriophage λ Red-mediated recombination, or “recombineering,” to uncover new L4 and L22 alleles that confer macrolide resistance in Escherichia coli. We randomized residues at the tips of the L4 and L22 loops using recombineered oligonucleotide libraries and selected the mutagenized cells for erythromycin-resistant mutants. These experiments led to the identification of 341 resistance mutations encoding 278 unique L4 and L22 proteins—the overwhelming majority of which are novel. Many resistance mutations were complex, involving multiple missense mutations, in-frame deletions, and insertions. Transfer of L4 and L22 mutations into wild-type cells by phage P1-mediated transduction demonstrated that each allele was sufficient to confer macrolide resistance. Although L4 and L22 mutants are typically resistant to most macrolides, selections carried out on different antibiotics revealed macrolide-specific resistance mutations. L22 Lys90Trp is one such allele that confers resistance to erythromycin but not to tylosin and spiramycin. Purified L22 Lys90Trp ribosomes show reduced erythromycin binding but have the same affinity for tylosin as wild-type ribosomes. Moreover, dimethyl sulfate methylation protection assays demonstrated that L22 Lys90Trp ribosomes bind tylosin more readily than erythromycin in vivo. This work underscores the exceptional functional plasticity of the L4 and L22 proteins and highlights the utility of Red-mediated recombination in targeted genetic selections.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Diner","given":"Elie J."},{"family":"Hayes","given":"Christopher S."}],"citation-key":"Diner2009","container-title":"Journal of Molecular Biology","container-title-short":"Journal of Molecular Biology","DOI":"10.1016/j.jmb.2008.12.064","ISSN":"0022-2836","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,2,20]]},"language":"en","page":"300-315","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Recombineering Reveals a Diverse Collection of Ribosomal Proteins L4 and L22 that Confer Resistance to Macrolide Antibiotics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283608016008","volume":"386"},

Finally, we show that NGD primarily proceeds via Xrn1-mediated exonucleolytic decay.

  {"id":"Floor2016","abstract":"To produce a protein, a gene’s DNA is first copied to make molecules of messenger RNA (mRNA). The mRNAs pass through a molecular machine known as the ribosome, which translates the genetic code to make a protein. Not all of an mRNA is translated to make a protein; the “untranslated” regions play crucial roles in regulating how much of the protein is produced. In animals, plants and other eukaryotes, many mRNAs are made up of small pieces that are “spliced” together. During this process, proteins are deposited on the mRNA to mark the splice junctions, which are then cleared when the mRNA is translated. Many different mRNAs can be produced from the same gene by splicing different combinations of RNA pieces. Each of these mRNA “isoforms” can, in principle, contain a unique set of features that control its translation. Hence each mRNA isoform can be translated differently so that different amounts of the corresponding protein product are produced. However, the relationship between the variety of isoforms and the control of translation is complex and not well understood. To address these questions, Floor and Doudna measured the translation of over 60,000 mRNA isoforms made from almost 14,000 human genes. The experiments show that untranslated regions at the end of the mRNA (known as the 3′ end) strongly influence translation, even if the protein coding regions remain the same. Furthermore, the data showed that mRNAs with more splice junctions are translated better, implying an mRNA has some sort of memory of how many junctions it had even after the protein markers have been cleared. Next, Floor and Doudna inserted regulatory sequences from differently translated isoforms into an unrelated “reporter” gene. This dramatically changed the amount of protein produced from the reporter gene, in a manner predicted by the earlier experiments. Untranslated regions at the beginning of the mRNAs (known as the 5′ end) controlled the amount of protein produced from the reporter consistently across different types of cells from the body. On the other hand, the 3′ regions can tune the level of protein production in particular types of cells. Floor and Doudna’s findings demonstrate that differences between mRNA isoforms of a gene can have a big effect on the level of protein production. Changes in the types of mRNA made from a gene are often associated with human diseases, and these findings suggest one reason why. Additionally, the ability to engineer translation of an mRNA using the data is likely to aid the development of mRNA-based therapies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,2,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Floor","given":"Stephen N."},{"family":"Doudna","given":"Jennifer A."}],"citation-key":"Floor2016","container-title":"eLife","DOI":"10.7554/eLife.10921","ISSN":"2050-084X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,1,6]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2016, Floor et al.

Current methods for the assembly of mammalian DNA circuits are laborious, slow, and expensive. Here we present the Mammalian ToolKit (MTK), a Golden Gate-based cloning toolkit for fast, reproducible, and versatile assembly of large DNA vectors and their implementation in mammalian models. The MTK consists of a curated library of characterized, modular parts that can be assembled into transcriptional units and further weaved into complex circuits. We showcase the capabilities of the MTK by using it to generate single-integration landing pads, create and deliver libraries of protein variants and sgRNAs, and iterate through dCas9-based prototype circuits. As a biological proof of concept, we demonstrate how the MTK can speed the generation of noninfectious viral circuits to enable rapid testing of pharmacological inhibitors of emerging viruses that pose a major threat to human health.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Fonseca","given":"João Pedro"},{"family":"Bonny","given":"Alain R."},{"family":"Kumar","given":"G.

  {"id":"Forrest2020","abstract":"Messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation plays a critical role in regulating transcript levels in the cell and is a major control point for modulating gene expression. In yeast and other model organisms, codon identity is a powerful determinant of transcript stability, contributing broadly to impact half-lives. General principles governing mRNA stability are poorly understood in mammalian systems. Importantly, however, the degradation machinery is highly conserved, thus it seems logical that mammalian transcript half-lives would also be strongly influenced by coding determinants. Herein we characterize the contribution of coding sequence towards mRNA decay in human and Chinese Hamster Ovary cells. In agreement with previous studies, we observed that synonymous codon usage impacts mRNA stability in mammalian cells. Surprisingly, however, we also observe that the amino acid content of a gene is an additional determinant correlating with transcript stability. The impact of codon and amino acid identity on mRNA decay appears to be associated with underlying tRNA and intracellular amino acid concentrations. Accordingly, genes of similar physiological function appear to coordinate their mRNA stabilities in part through codon and amino acid content. Together, these results raise the possibility that intracellular tRNA and amino acid levels interplay to mediate coupling between translational elongation and mRNA degradation rate in mammals.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Forrest","given":"Megan E."},{"family":"Pinkard","given":"Otis"},{"family":"Martin","given":"Sophie"},{"family":"Sweet","given":"Thomas J."},{"family":"Hanson","given":"Gavin"},{"family":"Coller","given":"Jeff"}],"citation-key":"Forrest2020","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0228730","editor":[{"family":"Kim","given":"Yoon Ki"}],"ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,13]]},"language":"en","page":"e0228730","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Codon and amino acid content are associated with mRNA stability in mammalian cells","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0228730","volume":"15"},
  {"id":"Fox2011","abstract":"The emergence of an RNA entity capable of synthesizing peptides was a key prebiotic development. It is hypothesized that a precursor of the modern ribosomal exit tunnel was associated with this RNA entity (e.g., “protoribosome” or “bonding entity”) from the earliest time and played an essential role. Various compounds that can bind and activate amino acids, including extremely short RNA chains carrying amino acids, and possibly di- or tripeptides, would have associated with the internal cavity of the protoribosome. This cavity hosts the site for peptide bond formation and adjacent to it a relatively elongated feature that could have evolved to the modern ribosomal exit tunnel, as it is wide enough to allow passage of an oligopeptide. When two of the compounds carrying amino acids or di- or tripeptides (to which we refer, for simplicity, as small aminoacylated RNAs) were in proximity within the heart of the protoribosome, a peptide bond could form spontaneously. The growing peptide would enter the nearby cavity and would not disrupt the attachment of the substrates to the protoribosome or interfere with the subsequent attachment of additional small aminoacylated RNAs. Additionally, the presence of the peptide in the cavity would increase the lifetime of the oligopeptide in the protoribosome. Thus, subsequent addition of another amino acid would be more likely than detachment from the protoribosome, and synthesis could continue.

  {"id":"Galmozzi2019","abstract":"A number of enzymes, targeting factors and chaperones engage ribosomes to support fundamental steps of nascent protein maturation, including enzymatic processing, membrane targeting and co-translational folding. The selective ribosome profiling (SeRP) method is a new tool for studying the co-translational activity of maturation factors that provides proteome-wide information on a factor’s nascent interactome, the onset and duration of binding and the mechanisms controlling factor engagement. SeRP is based on the combination of two ribosome-profiling (RP) experiments, sequencing the ribosome-protected mRNA fragments from all ribosomes (total translatome) and the ribosome subpopulation engaged by the factor of interest (factor-bound translatome). We provide a detailed SeRP protocol, exemplified for the yeast Hsp70 chaperone Ssb (stress 70 B), for studying factor interactions with nascent proteins that is readily adaptable to identifying nascent interactomes of other co-translationally acting eukaryotic factors. The protocol provides general guidance for experimental design and optimization, as well as detailed instructions for cell growth and harvest, the isolation of (factor-engaged) monosomes, the generation of a cDNA library and data analysis. Experience in biochemistry and RNA handling, as well as basic programing knowledge, is necessary to perform SeRP. Execution of a SeRP experiment takes 8–10 working days, and initial data analysis can be completed within 1–2 d.

  {"id":"Gillen2021","abstract":"Background: Regulation of protein output at the level of translation allows for a rapid adaptation to dynamic changes to the cell’s requirements. This precise control of gene expression is achieved by complex and interlinked biochemical processes that modulate both the protein synthesis rate and stability of each individual mRNA. A major factor coordinating this regulation is the Ccr4-Not complex. Despite playing a role in most stages of the mRNA life cycle, no attempt has been made to take a global integrated view of how the Ccr4-Not complex affects gene expression.\nResults: This study has taken a comprehensive approach to investigate posttranscriptional regulation mediated by the Ccr4-Not complex assessing steady-state mRNA levels, ribosome position, mRNA stability, and protein production transcriptome-wide. Depletion of the scaffold protein CNOT1 results in a global upregulation of mRNA stability and the preferential stabilization of mRNAs enriched for G/C-ending codons. We also uncover that mRNAs targeted to the ER for their translation have reduced translational efficiency when CNOT1 is depleted, specifically downstream of the signal sequence cleavage site. In contrast, translationally upregulated mRNAs are normally localized in p-bodies, contain disorder-promoting amino acids, and encode nuclear localized proteins. Finally, we identify ribosome pause sites that are resolved or induced by the depletion of CNOT1.\nConclusions: We define the key mRNA features that determine how the human Ccr4-Not complex differentially regulates mRNA fate and protein synthesis through a mechanism linked to codon composition, amino acid usage, and mRNA localization.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Gillen","given":"Sarah L."},{"family":"Giacomelli","given":"Chiara"},{"family":"Hodge","given":"Kelly"},{"family":"Zanivan","given":"Sara"},{"family":"Bushell","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Wilczynska","given":"Ania"}],"citation-key":"Gillen2021","container-title":"Genome Biology","container-title-short":"Genome Biol","DOI":"10.1186/s13059-021-02494-w","ISSN":"1474-760X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,12]]},"language":"en","page":"284","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Differential regulation of mRNA fate by the human Ccr4-Not complex is driven by coding sequence composition and mRNA localization","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-021-02494-w","volume":"22"},

Measuring tRNA pools in various cell types, we found two distinct subsets, one that is induced in proliferating cells, and repressed otherwise, and another with the opposite signature. Correspondingly, we found that genes serving cell-autonomous functions and genes involved in multicellularity obey distinct codon usage. Proliferation-induced and differentiation-induced tRNAs often carry anticodons that correspond to the codons enriched among the cell-autonomous and the multicellularity genes, respectively. Because mRNAs of cell-autonomous genes are induced in proliferation and cancer in particular, the concomitant induction of their codon-enriched tRNAs suggests coordination between transcription and translation. Histone modifications indeed change similarly in the vicinity of cell-autonomous genes and their corresponding tRNAs, and in multicellularity genes and their tRNAs, suggesting the existence of transcriptional programs coordinating tRNA supply and demand.

We modeled codon-specific ribosome dwell times from ribosome profiling, considering codon pair interactions between ribosome sites. In mouse liver, the model revealed site- and codon-specific dwell times that differed from those in yeast, as well as pairs of adjacent codons in the P and A site that markedly slow down or speed up elongation.

  {"id":"Goldman2015","abstract":"Force to unblock a clogged ribosome\nThe synthesis of proteins from mRNA by the ribosome is highly regulated. But newly synthesized protein chains can still block the ribosome exit tunnel and slow protein synthesis. Goldman et al. use optical tweezers to show that by pulling on the stuck protein chain, they can unblock a clogged exit tunnel (see the Perspective by Puglisi). In vivo, the folding of a nascent protein chain just outside the tunnel also generates enough force to unclog a block, indicating that ribosome-peptide interactions fine-tune protein synthesis.\nScience, this issue p. 457; see also p. 399\nProtein synthesis rates can affect gene expression and the folding and activity of the translation product. Interactions between the nascent polypeptide and the ribosome exit tunnel represent one mode of regulating synthesis rates. The SecM protein arrests its own translation, and release of arrest at the translocon has been proposed to occur by mechanical force. Using optical tweezers, we demonstrate that arrest of SecM-stalled ribosomes can indeed be rescued by force alone and that the force needed to release stalling can be generated in vivo by a nascent chain folding near the ribosome tunnel exit. We formulate a kinetic model describing how a protein can regulate its own synthesis by the force generated during folding, tuning ribosome activity to structure acquisition by a nascent polypeptide.\nThe interactions between a protein nascent chain and the ribosome exit tunnel can regulate protein synthesis.

Here, we focus on closely related neuronal microexons overlapping prion-like domains in the translation initiation factors, eIF4G1 and eIF4G3, the splicing of which is activity dependent and frequently disrupted in autism. CRISPR-Cas9 deletion of these microexons selectively upregulates synaptic proteins that control neuronal activity and plasticity and further triggers a gene expression program mirroring that of activated neurons. Mice lacking the Eif4g1 microexon display social behavior, learning, and memory deficits, accompanied by altered hippocampal synaptic plasticity. We provide evidence that the eIF4G microexons function as a translational brake by causing ribosome stalling, through their propensity to promote the coalescence of cytoplasmic granule components associated with translation repression, including the fragile X mental retardation protein FMRP.

Here we identify the molecular mechanism of codon pair deoptimization-based attenuation by studying recoded influenza A viruses. We show that suboptimal codon pairs cause attenuation, whereas the increase of CpG dinucleotides has no effect. Furthermore, we show that suboptimal codon pairs reduce both mRNA stability and translation efficiency of codon pair-deoptimized genes. Consequently, reduced protein production directly causes virus attenuation. Our study provides evidence that suboptimal codon pairs are major determinants of mRNA stability.

  {"id":"Gumbart2012","abstract":"Nascent-peptide modulation of translation is a common regulatory mechanism of gene expression. In this mechanism, while the nascent peptide is still in the exit tunnel of the ribosome, it induces translational pausing, thereby controlling the expression of downstream genes. One example is SecM, which inhibits peptide-bond formation in the ribosome's peptidyl transferase center (PTC) during its own translation, upregulating the expression of the protein translocase SecA. Although biochemical experiments and cryo-electron microscopy data have led to the identification of some residues involved in SecM recognition, the full pathway of interacting residues that connect SecM to the PTC through the ribosome has not yet been conclusively established. Here, using the cryo-electron microscopy data, we derived the first (to our knowledge) atomic model of the SecM-stalled ribosome via molecular-dynamics flexible fitting, complete with P- and A-site tRNAs. Subsequently, we carried out simulations of native and mutated SecM-stalled ribosomes to investigate possible interaction pathways between a critical SecM residue, R163, and the PTC. In particular, the simulations reveal the role of SecM in altering the position of the tRNAs in the ribosome, and thus demonstrate how the presence of SecM in the exit tunnel induces stalling. Finally, steered molecular-dynamics simulations in which SecM was pulled toward the tunnel exit suggest how SecA interacting with SecM from outside the ribosome relieves stalling.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Gumbart","given":"James"},{"family":"Schreiner","given":"Eduard"},{"family":"Wilson","given":"Daniel N."},{"family":"Beckmann","given":"Roland"},{"family":"Schulten","given":"Klaus"}],"citation-key":"Gumbart2012","container-title":"Biophysical Journal","container-title-short":"Biophysical Journal","DOI":"10.1016/j.bpj.2012.06.005","ISSN":"0006-3495","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,7,18]]},"language":"en","page":"331-341","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Mechanisms of SecM-Mediated Stalling in the Ribosome","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349512006601","volume":"103"},

However, the codon?anticodon co-adaptation in humans is not completely understood, nor is its effect on tissue-specific protein levels. Here, we first validated the accuracy of small RNA-seq for tRNA quantification across five human cell lines. We then analyzed the tRNA abundance of more than 8,000 tumor samples from TCGA, together with their paired mRNA-seq and proteomics data, to determine the Supply-to-Demand Adaptation. We thereby elucidate that the dynamic adaptation of the tRNA pool is largely related to the proliferative state across tissues. The distribution of such tRNA pools over the whole cellular translatome affects the subsequent translational efficiency, which functionally determines a condition-specific expression program both in healthy and tumor states. Furthermore, the aberrant translational efficiency of some codons in cancer, exemplified by ProCCA and GlyGGT, is associated with poor patient survival. The regulation of these tRNA profiles is partly explained by the tRNA gene copy numbers and their promoter DNA methylation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Hernandez-Alias","given":"Xavier"},{"family":"Benisty","given":"Hannah"},{"family":"Schaefer","given":"Martin H"},{"family":"Serrano","given":"Luis"}],"citation-key":"Hernandez-Alias2020","container-title":"Molecular Systems Biology","container-title-short":"Molecular Systems Biology","DOI":"10.15252/msb.20199275","ISSN":"1744-4292","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,1]]},"page":"e9275","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","source":"embopress.org (Atypon)","title":"Translational efficiency across healthy and tumor tissues is proliferation-related","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/msb.20199275","volume":"16"},

To investigate the function of each determinant, one or both were fused in frame to portions of a gene encoding long-lived beta-globin mRNA. Each chimeric gene was stably transfected into HeLa and NIH 3T3 cells and was transcribed from a constitutive cytomegalovirus promoter or from a serum-regulated c-fos promoter, respectively. The steady-state levels of the chimeric mRNAs in exponentially growing HeLa cells were compared, and their half-lives were measured by two independent methods: (i) in actinomycin D-treated HeLa cells and (ii) after serum addition to starved 3T3 cells. By each method, mRNAs containing either instability determinant were less stable than beta-globin mRNA. mRNA containing only the c-myc 3' untranslated region was not significantly more stable than mRNA with both determinants. In a cell-free mRNA decay system containing polysomes from transfected HeLa cells, mRNA containing the coding-region determinant was destabilized by addition of a specific RNA competitor, whereas mRNA containing only the 3' untranslated region was unaffected. When a stop codon was inserted upstream of the coding-region determinant, the chimeric mRNA was stabilized approximately twofold.

However, the molecular mechanisms of codon bias on mRNA stability remain unclear in humans. Here, we show that human cells possess a mechanism to modulate RNA stability through a unique codon bias. Bioinformatics analysis showed that codons could be clustered into two distinct groups?codons with G or C at the third base position (GC3) and codons with either A or T at the third base position (AT3): the former stabilizing while the latter destabilizing mRNA. Quantification of codon bias showed that increased GC3-content entails proportionately higher GC-content. Through bioinformatics, ribosome profiling, and in vitro analysis, we show that decoupling the effects of codon bias reveals two modes of mRNA regulation, one GC3- and one GC-content dependent. Employing an immunoprecipitation-based strategy, we identify ILF2 and ILF3 as RNA-binding proteins that differentially regulate global mRNA abundances based on codon bias. Our results demonstrate that codon bias is a two-pronged system that governs mRNA abundance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Hia","given":"Fabian"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Sheng Fan"},{"family":"Shichino","given":"Yuichi"},{"family":"Yoshinaga","given":"Masanori"},{"family":"Murakawa","given":"Yasuhiro"},{"family":"Vandenbon","given":"Alexis"},{"family":"Fukao","given":"Akira"},{"family":"Fujiwara","given":"Toshinobu"},{"family":"Landthaler","given":"Markus"},{"family":"Natsume","given":"Tohru"},{"family":"Adachi","given":"Shungo"},{"family":"Iwasaki","given":"Shintaro"},{"family":"Takeuchi","given":"Osamu"}],"citation-key":"Hia2019","container-title":"EMBO reports","container-title-short":"EMBO reports","DOI":"10.15252/embr.201948220","ISSN":"1469-221X","issue":"0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,3]]},"page":"e48220","source":"embopress.org (Atypon)","title":"Codon bias confers stability to human mRNAs","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/embr.201948220","volume":"0"},

  {"id":"Iordanov1997","abstract":"Inhibition of protein synthesis per se does not potentiate the stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs; also known as cJun NH2-terminal kinases [JNKs]). The protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin, however, is a potent activator of SAPKs/JNKs. The mechanism of this activation is unknown. We provide evidence that in order to activate SAPK/JNK1, anisomycin requires ribosomes that are translationally active at the time of contact with the drug, suggesting a ribosomal origin of the anisomycin-induced signaling to SAPK/JNK1. In support of this notion, we have found that aminohexose pyrimidine nucleoside antibiotics, which bind to the same region in the 28S rRNA that is the target site for anisomycin, are also potent activators of SAPK/JNK1. Binding of an antibiotic to the 28S rRNA interferes with the functioning of the molecule by altering the structural interactions of critical regions. We hypothesized, therefore, that such alterations in the 28S rRNA may act as recognition signals to activate SAPK/JNK1. To test this hypothesis, we made use of two ribotoxic enzymes, ricin A chain and alpha-sarcin, both of which catalyze sequence-specific RNA damage in the 28S rRNA. Consistent with our hypothesis, ricin A chain and alpha-sarcin were strong agonists of SAPK/JNK1 and of its activator SEK1/MKK4 and induced the expression of the immediate-early genes c-fos and c-jun. As in the case of anisomycin, ribosomes that were active at the time of exposure to ricin A chain or alpha-sarcin were able to initiate signal transduction from the damaged 28S rRNA to SAPK/JNK1 while inactive ribosomes were not.","author":[{"family":"Iordanov","given":"M.

A class of proteins, called ribosome arrest peptides, contains specific sequences of amino acids (arrest sequences) that interact with distinct components of the PTC–exit tunnel region of the ribosome and arrest their own translation continuation, often in a manner regulated by environmental cues. Thus, the ribosome that has translated an arrest sequence is inactivated for peptidyl transfer, translocation, or termination. The stalled ribosome then changes the configuration or localization of mRNA, resulting in specific biological outputs, including regulation of the target gene expression and downstream events of mRNA/polypeptide maturation or localization. Living organisms thus seem to have integrated potentially harmful arrest sequences into elaborate regulatory mechanisms to express genetic information in productive directions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Ito","given":"Koreaki"},{"family":"Chiba","given":"Shinobu"}],"citation-key":"Ito2013","container-title":"Annual Review of Biochemistry","container-title-short":"Annu.

This molecular insult results in a cascade of intracellular events termed the ribotoxic stress response (RSR). Although Stxs and ricin have been shown to cause the RSR, the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) that transduces the signal from intoxicated ribosomes to activate SAPKinases has remained elusive. We show in vitro that DHP-2 (7-[3-fluoro-4-aminophenyl-(4-(2-pyridin-2-yl-5,6-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo[1,2-b]pyrazol-3-yl))]-quinoline), a zipper sterile-α-motif kinase (ZAK)-specific inhibitor, blocks Stx2/ricin-induced SAPKinase activation. Treatment of cells with DHP-2 also blocks Stx2/ricin-mediated upregulation of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-8 and results in a modest but statistically significant improvement in cell viability following Stx2/ricin treatment. Finally we show that siRNA directed against the N-terminus of ZAK diminishes Stx2/Ricin-induced SAPKinase activation. Together, these data demonstrate that a ZAK isoform(s) is the MAP3Kinase that transduces the RSR. Therefore, ZAKα and/or β isoforms may act as potential therapeutic target(s) for treating Stx/ricin-associated illnesses. Furthermore, a small molecule inhibitor like DHP-2 may prove valuable in preventing the Stx/ricin-induced proinflammatory and/or apoptotic effects that are thought to contribute to pathogenesis by Stx-producing Escherichia coli and ricin.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Jandhyala","given":"Dakshina M."},{"family":"Ahluwalia","given":"Amrita"},{"family":"Obrig","given":"Tom"},{"family":"Thorpe","given":"Cheleste M."}],"citation-key":"Jandhyala2008","container-title":"Cellular Microbiology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1462-5822.2008.01139.x","ISSN":"1462-5822","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008]]},"language":"en","license":"Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Rhythmic transcription underlies the core clock mechanism, but it cannot explain numerous observations made at the level of protein rhythmicity. We have used ribosome profiling in mouse liver to measure the translation of mRNAs into protein around the clock and at high temporal and nucleotide resolution. We discovered, transcriptome-wide, extensive rhythms in ribosome occupancy and identified a core set of approximately 150 mRNAs subject to particularly robust daily changes in translation efficiency. Cycling proteins produced from nonoscillating transcripts revealed thus-far-unknown rhythmic regulation associated with specific pathways (notably in iron metabolism, through the rhythmic translation of transcripts containing iron responsive elements), and indicated feedback to the rhythmic transcriptome through novel rhythmic transcription factors. Moreover, estimates of relative levels of core clock protein biosynthesis that we deduced from the data explained known features of the circadian clock better than did mRNA expression alone. Finally, we identified uORF translation as a novel regulatory mechanism within the clock circuitry. Consistent with the occurrence of translated uORFs in several core clock transcripts, loss-of-function of Denr, a known regulator of reinitiation after uORF usage and of ribosome recycling, led to circadian period shortening in cells. In summary, our data offer a framework for understanding the dynamics of translational regulation, circadian gene expression, and metabolic control in a solid mammalian organ.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Janich","given":"Peggy"},{"family":"Arpat","given":"Alaaddin Bulak"},{"family":"Castelo-Szekely","given":"Violeta"},{"family":"Lopes","given":"Maykel"},{"family":"Gatfield","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"Janich2015","container-title":"Genome Research","container-title-short":"Genome Res.","DOI":"10.1101/gr.195404.115","ISSN":"1088-9051, 1549-5469","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1848-1859","PMID":"26486724","publisher":"Cold Spring Harbor Lab","source":"genome.cshlp.org","title":"Ribosome profiling reveals the rhythmic liver translatome and circadian clock regulation by upstream open reading frames","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://genome.cshlp.org/content/25/12/1848","volume":"25"},

However, the ubiquitin ligases, biochemical consequences, and physiologic pathways linked to these modifications are not known. Here, we show in mammalian cells that the ubiquitin ligase ZNF598 is required for ribosomes to terminally stall during translation of poly(A) sequences. ZNF598-mediated stalling initiated the ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) pathway for degradation of nascent truncated proteins. Biochemical ubiquitination reactions identified two sites of mono-ubiquitination on the 40S protein eS10 as the primary ribosomal target of ZNF598. Cells lacking ZNF598 activity or containing ubiquitination-resistant eS10 ribosomes failed to stall efficiently on poly(A) sequences. In the absence of stalling, read-through of poly(A) produces a poly-lysine tag, which might alter the localization and solubility of the associated protein. Thus, ribosome ubiquitination can modulate translation elongation and impacts co-translational quality control to minimize production of aberrant proteins.","author":[{"family":"Juszkiewicz","given":"Szymon"},{"family":"Hegde","given":"Ramanujan S."}],"citation-key":"Juszkiewicz2017","container-title":"Molecular Cell","container-title-short":"Mol Cell","DOI":"10.1016/j.molcel.2016.11.039","ISSN":"1097-4164","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,2,16]]},"language":"eng","page":"743-750.e4","PMCID":"PMC5316413","PMID":"28065601","source":"PubMed","title":"Initiation of Quality Control during Poly(A) Translation Requires Site-Specific Ribosome Ubiquitination","type":"article-journal","volume":"65"},

The collided di-ribosome structure reveals an extensive 40S-40S interface in which the ubiquitination targets of ZNF598 reside. The paucity of 60S interactions allows for different ribosome rotation states, explaining why ZNF598 recognition is indifferent to how the leading ribosome has stalled. The use of ribosome collisions as a proxy for stalling allows the degree of tolerable slowdown to be tuned by the initiation rate on that mRNA; hence, the threshold for triggering quality control is substrate speciﬁc.

EDF1 stabilises GIGYF2 at collisions to inhibit translation initiation in cis via 4EHP. The GIGYF2 axis acts independently of the ZNF598 axis, but each pathway’s output is more pronounced without the other.

  {"id":"Knight2020","abstract":"Skip to Next Section\nRegulation of protein synthesis makes a major contribution to post-transcriptional control pathways. During disease, or under stress, cells initiate processes to reprogramme protein synthesis and thus orchestrate the appropriate cellular response. Recent data show that the elongation stage of protein synthesis is a key regulatory node for translational control in health and disease. There is a complex set of factors that individually affect the overall rate of elongation and, for the most part, these influence either transfer RNA (tRNA)- and eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A)-dependent codon decoding, and/or elongation factor 2 (eEF2)-dependent ribosome translocation along the mRNA. Decoding speeds depend on the relative abundance of each tRNA, the cognate:near-cognate tRNA ratios and the degree of tRNA modification, whereas eEF2-dependent ribosome translocation is negatively regulated by phosphorylation on threonine-56 by eEF2 kinase. Additional factors that contribute to the control of the elongation rate include epigenetic modification of the mRNA, coding sequence variation and the expression of eIF5A, which stimulates peptide bond formation between proline residues. Importantly, dysregulation of elongation control is central to disease mechanisms in both tumorigenesis and neurodegeneration, making the individual key steps in this process attractive therapeutic targets. Here, we discuss the relative contribution of individual components of the translational apparatus (e.g. tRNAs, elongation factors and their modifiers) to the overall control of translation elongation and how their dysregulation contributes towards disease processes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Knight","given":"John R.

  {"id":"Kolar2021","abstract":"<p>The ribosome is a fundamental biomolecular complex responsible for protein production in cells. Nascent proteins emerge from the ribosome through a tunnel, where they may interact with the tunnel walls or small molecules such as antibiotics. These interactions can cause translational arrest with notable physiologic consequences. Here, we studied the arrest caused by the regulatory peptide VemP, which is known to form an α-helix in the ribosome tunnel near the peptidyl transferase center under specific conditions. We used all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the entire ribosome and circular dichroism spectroscopy to study the driving forces of helix formation and how VemP causes the translational arrest. To that aim, we compared VemP dynamics in the ribosome tunnel with its dynamics in solution. We show that the VemP sequence has a low helical propensity in water and that the propensity is higher in more hydrophobic solvents. We propose that helix formation within the ribosome is driven by the tunnel environment and that a portion of VemP acts as an anchor. This anchor might slow down VemP progression through the tunnel enabling the α-helix formation, which causes the elongation arrest.</p>","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Kolar","given":"Michal H."},{"family":"Nagy","given":"Gabor"},{"family":"Kunkel","given":"John"},{"family":"Vaiana","given":"Sara M."},{"family":"Bock","given":"Lars V."},{"family":"Grubmuller","given":"Helmut"}],"citation-key":"Kolar2021","container-title":"bioRxiv","DOI":"10.1101/2021.04.15.440051","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,15]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2021, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

  {"id":"Kovalevich2013","abstract":"The use of primary mammalian neurons derived from embryonic central nervous system tissue is limited by the fact that once terminally differentiated into mature neurons, the cells can no longer be propagated. Transformed neuronal-like cell lines can be used in vitro to overcome this limitation. However, several caveats exist when utilizing cells derived from malignant tumors. In this context, the popular SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line and its use in in vitro systems is described. Originally derived from a metastatic bone tumor biopsy, SH-SY5Y (ATCC® CRL-2266™) cells are a subline of the parental line SK-N-SH (ATCC® HTB-11™). SK-N-SH were subcloned three times; first to SH-SY, then to SH-SY5, and finally to SH-SY5Y. SH-SY5Y were deposited to the ATCC® in 1970 by June L. Biedler.Three important characteristics of SH-SY5Y cells should be considered when using these cells in in vitro studies. First, cultures include both adherent and floating cells, both types of which are viable. Few studies address the biological significance of the adherent versus floating phenotypes, but most reported studies utilize adherent populations and discard the floating cells during media changes. Second, early studies by Biedler’s group indicated that the parental differentiated SK-N-SH cells contained two morphologically distinct phenotypes: neuroblast-like cells and epithelial-like cells (Ross et al., J Nat Cancer Inst 71:741–747, 1983). These two phenotypes may correspond to the “N” and “S” types described in later studies in SH-SY5Y by Encinas et al. (J Neurochem 75:991–1003, 2000). Cells with neuroblast-like morphology are positive for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine-β-hydroxylase characteristic of catecholaminergic neurons, whereas the epithelial-like counterpart cells lacked these enzymatic activities (Ross et al., J Nat Cancer Inst 71:741–747, 1983). Third, SH-SY5Y cells can be differentiated to a more mature neuron-like phenotype that is characterized by neuronal markers. There are several methods to differentiate SH-SY5Y cells and are mentioned below. Retinoic acid is the most commonly used means for differentiation and will be addressed in detail.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Kovalevich","given":"Jane"},{"family":"Langford","given":"Dianne"}],"citation-key":"Kovalevich2013","collection-title":"Methods in Molecular Biology","container-title":"Neuronal Cell Culture: Methods and Protocols","DOI":"10.1007/978-1-62703-640-5_2","editor":[{"family":"Amini","given":"Shohreh"},{"family":"White","given":"Martyn K."}],"event-place":"Totowa, NJ","ISBN":"978-1-62703-640-5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"language":"en","page":"9-21","publisher":"Humana Press","publisher-place":"Totowa, NJ","source":"Springer Link","title":"Considerations for the Use of SH-SY5Y Neuroblastoma Cells in Neurobiology","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-62703-640-5_2"},
  {"id":"Kramer2009","abstract":"The early events in the life of newly synthesized proteins in the cellular environment are remarkably complex. Concurrently with their synthesis by the ribosome, nascent polypeptides are subjected to enzymatic processing, chaperone-assisted folding or targeting to translocation pores at membranes. The ribosome itself has a key role in these different tasks and governs the interplay between the various factors involved. Indeed, the ribosome serves as a platform for the spatially and temporally regulated association of enzymes, targeting factors and chaperones that act upon the nascent polypeptides emerging from the exit tunnel. Furthermore, the ribosome provides opportunities to coordinate the protein-synthesis activity of its peptidyl transferase center with the protein targeting and folding processes.

  {"id":"Kraushar2021","abstract":"Protein synthesis must be finely tuned in the developing nervous system as the final essential step of gene expression. This study investigates the architecture of ribosomes from the neocortex during neurogenesis, revealing Ebp1 as a high-occupancy 60S peptide tunnel exit (TE) factor during protein synthesis at near-atomic resolution by cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM). Ribosome profiling demonstrated Ebp1-60S binding is highest during start codon initiation and N-terminal peptide elongation, regulating ribosome occupancy of these codons. Membrane-targeting domains emerging from the 60S tunnel, which recruit SRP/Sec61 to the shared binding site, displace Ebp1. Ebp1 is particularly abundant in the early-born neural stem cell (NSC) lineage and regulates neuronal morphology. Ebp1 especially impacts the synthesis of membrane-targeted cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), measured by pulsed stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (pSILAC)/bioorthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT) mass spectrometry (MS). Therefore, Ebp1 is a central component of protein synthesis, and the ribosome TE is a focal point of gene expression control in the molecular specification of neuronal morphology during development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Kraushar","given":"Matthew L."},{"family":"Krupp","given":"Ferdinand"},{"family":"Harnett","given":"Dermot"},{"family":"Turko","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Ambrozkiewicz","given":"Mateusz C."},{"family":"Sprink","given":"Thiemo"},{"family":"Imami","given":"Koshi"},{"family":"Günnigmann","given":"Manuel"},{"family":"Zinnall","given":"Ulrike"},{"family":"Vieira-Vieira","given":"Carlos H."},{"family":"Schaub","given":"Theres"},{"family":"Münster-Wandowski","given":"Agnieszka"},{"family":"Bürger","given":"Jörg"},{"family":"Borisova","given":"Ekaterina"},{"family":"Yamamoto","given":"Hiroshi"},{"family":"Rasin","given":"Mladen-Roko"},{"family":"Ohler","given":"Uwe"},{"family":"Beule","given":"Dieter"},{"family":"Mielke","given":"Thorsten"},{"family":"Tarabykin","given":"Victor"},{"family":"Landthaler","given":"Markus"},{"family":"Kramer","given":"Günter"},{"family":"Vida","given":"Imre"},{"family":"Selbach","given":"Matthias"},{"family":"Spahn","given":"Christian M.

  {"id":"Kriachkov2022","abstract":"Hexanucleotide expansion mutations in C9ORF72 are a cause of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We previously reported that long arginine-rich dipeptide repeats (DPR), mimicking abnormal proteins expressed from the hexanucleotide expansion, caused translation stalling when expressed in cell culture models. Whether this stalling provides a mechanism of pathogenicity remains to be determined. Here we explored the molecular features of DPR-induced stalling and examined whether known regulatory mechanisms of ribosome quality control (RQC) are involved to sense and resolve the stalls. We demonstrate that arginine-containing DPRs lead to stalling in a length dependent manner, with lengths longer than 40 repeats invoking severe translation arrest. Mutational screening of 40×Gly-Xxx DPRs shows that stalling is most pronounced where Xxx are positively charged amino acids (Arg or Lys). Through a genome-wide knockout screen we find that genes regulating stalling on polyadenosine mRNA coding for poly-Lys, a canonical RQC substrate, respond differently to the readthrough of arginine-rich DPRs. Indeed, we find evidence that DPR-mediated stalling has no natural regulatory responses even though the stalls may be sensed, as evidenced by an upregulation of RQC gene expression. These findings therefore implicate arginine-rich DPR-mediated stalled ribosomes as posing a particular danger to cellular health and viability.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Kriachkov","given":"Viacheslav"},{"family":"McWilliam","given":"Hamish E G"},{"family":"Mintern","given":"Justine D"},{"family":"Amarasinghe","given":"Shanika L"},{"family":"Ritchie","given":"Matt"},{"family":"Furic","given":"Luc"},{"family":"Hatters","given":"Danny M"}],"citation-key":"Kriachkov2022","DOI":"10.1101/2022.02.09.479805","genre":"preprint","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,10]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Biochemistry","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Arginine-rich C9ORF72 ALS Proteins Stall Ribosomes in a Manner Distinct From a Canonical Ribosome-Associated Quality Control Substrate","type":"report","URL":"http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2022.02.09.479805"},

  {"id":"Lemm2002","abstract":"A 249-nucleotide coding region instability determinant (CRD) destabilizes c-myc mRNA. Previous experiments identified a CRD-binding protein (CRD-BP) that appears to protect the CRD from endonuclease cleavage. However, it was unclear why a CRD-BP is required to protect a well-translated mRNA whose coding region is covered with ribosomes. We hypothesized that translational pausing in the CRD generates a ribosome-deficient region downstream of the pause site, and this region is exposed to endonuclease attack unless it is shielded by the CRD-BP. Transfection and cell-free translation experiments reported here support this hypothesis. Ribosome pausing occurs within the c-myc CRD in tRNA-depleted reticulocyte translation reactions. The pause sites map to a rare arginine (CGA) codon and to an adjacent threonine (ACA) codon. Changing these codons to more common codons increases translational efficiency in vitro and increases mRNA abundance in transfected cells. These data suggest that c-myc mRNA is rapidly degraded unless it is (i) translated without pausing or (ii) protected by the CRD-BP when pausing occurs. Additional mapping experiments suggest that the CRD is bipartite, with several upstream translation pause sites and a downstream endonuclease cleavage site.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Lemm","given":"Ira"},{"family":"Ross","given":"Jeff"}],"citation-key":"Lemm2002","container-title":"Molecular and Cellular Biology","DOI":"10.1128/MCB.22.12.3959-3969.2002","ISSN":"0270-7306, 1098-5549","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2002,6,15]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright © 2002 American Society for Microbiology","page":"3959-3969","PMID":"12024010","publisher":"American Society for Microbiology Journals","section":"GENE EXPRESSION","source":"mcb.asm.org","title":"Regulation of c-myc mRNA Decay by Translational Pausing in a Coding Region Instability Determinant","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://mcb.asm.org/content/22/12/3959","volume":"22"},

  {"id":"Li2018","abstract":"ZAK, a mixed lineage kinase, is often described as a positive or negative regulator of cell growth. We identified it as one of the top hits in our kinome cDNA screen for potent regulators of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT). Ectopic expression of ZAK promoted EMT phenotypes and apoptosis resistance in multiple epithelial cell lines, while having different impacts on cell growth in different cell lines. Conversely, depletion of ZAK in aggressive mesenchymal cancer cells reversed EMT phenotypes, increased sensitivity to conventional cytotoxic drugs, and attenuated bone metastasis potential, with little impact on primary tumor growth. Mechanistically, ZAK-mediated EMT is associated with activation of ZEB1 and suppression of epithelial splicing regulatory proteins (ESRPs), which results in a switch in CD44 expression from the epithelial CD44v8–9 isoform to the mesenchymal CD44s isoform. Of note, transcriptomic analysis showed that ZAK overexpression is significantly associated with poor survival in a number of human cancer types. Tissue microarray analysis on breast invasive carcinoma further supported that ZAK overexpression is an independent poor prognostic factor for overall survival in breast cancer. Through combination with ZAK, prognostic accuracy of other common clinicopathological markers in breast cancer is improved by up to 21%. Taken together, these results suggest that promoting EMT is the primary role for ZAK in cancer progression. They also highlight its potential as a biomarker to identify high-risk patients, and suggest its promise as a therapeutic target for inhibiting metastasis and overcoming drug resistance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Linna"},{"family":"Su","given":"Ning"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Ting"},{"family":"Zheng","given":"Dayong"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Zheng"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Haoyu"},{"family":"Yuan","given":"Shoujun"},{"family":"Li","given":"Wenliang"}],"citation-key":"Li2018","container-title":"Cell Death & Disease","container-title-short":"Cell Death Dis","DOI":"10.1038/s41419-017-0161-x","ISSN":"2041-4889","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,2,2]]},"language":"en","license":"2018 The Author(s)","note":"Bandiera_abtest: a\nCc_license_type: cc_by\nCg_type: Nature Research Journals\nPrimary_atype: Research","number":"2","page":"1-14","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Mixed lineage kinase ZAK promotes epithelial–mesenchymal transition in cancer progression","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41419-017-0161-x","volume":"9"},

  {"id":"Liaud2019","abstract":"Identifying small molecules that inhibit protein synthesis by selectively stalling the ribosome constitutes a new strategy for therapeutic development. Compounds that inhibit the translation of PCSK9, a major regulator of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, have been identified that reduce LDL cholesterol in preclinical models and that affect the translation of only a few off-target proteins. Although some of these compounds hold potential for future therapeutic development, it is not known how they impact the physiology of cells or ribosome quality control pathways. Here we used a genome-wide CRISPRi screen to identify proteins and pathways that modulate cell growth in the presence of high doses of a selective PCSK9 translational inhibitor, PF-06378503 (PF8503). The two most potent genetic modifiers of cell fitness in the presence of PF8503, the ubiquitin binding protein ASCC2 and helicase ASCC3, bind to the ribosome and protect cells from toxic effects of high concentrations of the compound. Surprisingly, translation quality control proteins Pelota (PELO) and HBS1L sensitize cells to PF8503 treatment. In genetic interaction experiments, ASCC3 acts together with ASCC2, and functions downstream of HBS1L. Taken together, these results identify new connections between ribosome quality control pathways, and provide new insights into the selectivity of compounds that stall human translation that will aid the development of next-generation selective translation stalling compounds to treat disease.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Liaud","given":"Nadège"},{"family":"Horlbeck","given":"Max A."},{"family":"Gilbert","given":"Luke A."},{"family":"Gjoni","given":"Ketrin"},{"family":"Weissman","given":"Jonathan S."},{"family":"Cate","given":"Jamie H.

Most abundance control mechanisms involve feedback regulation of mRNA transcription, but others, such as tubulins, are regulated by highly specific mRNA degradation. Lin et al. found that tetratricopeptide protein 5 (TTC5) binds to nascent alpha and beta tubulins on translating ribosomes to trigger degradation of their associated mRNAs when excess tubulin is present (see the Perspective by Shoshani and Cleveland). In the absence of TTC5-mediated tubulin autoregulation, cells display error-prone chromosome segregation, a process critically dependent on tubulin concentration.\nScience, this issue p. 100; see also p. 29\nTubulins play crucial roles in cell division, intracellular traffic, and cell shape. Tubulin concentration is autoregulated by feedback control of messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation via an unknown mechanism. We identified tetratricopeptide protein 5 (TTC5) as a tubulin-specific ribosome-associating factor that triggers cotranslational degradation of tubulin mRNAs in response to excess soluble tubulin. Structural analysis revealed that TTC5 binds near the ribosome exit tunnel and engages the amino terminus of nascent tubulins.

This decrease in transcription is associated with a change in the chromatin structure of c-myc, as measured by deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) hypersensitivity, and a shift of transcription from the LTR to the normal c-myc promoter. In contrast, cycloheximide had little or no effect on the transcription of LTR driven genes in infected chicken embryo fibroblasts treated with the drug. These results suggest that a labile, cell type-specific protein may interact with the retroviral LTR and regulate transcription of genes under LTR control.

In this paper, we report that a small molecule, PF-06446846, directly inhibits translation of one such protein, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), by acting on the translating human ribosome. PF-06446846 causes the translating ribosome to stall soon after translating the PCSK9 signal sequence. We further show that PF-06446846 activity is dependent on the amino acid sequence of the nascent chain inside the ribosome exit tunnel. In a rat safety study, we observe decreases in plasma PCSK9, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Using mass spectrometry in cell culture and ribosome profiling, we demonstrate that despite acting on the ribosome, which synthesizes every protein in the cell, PF-06446846 displays a high level of selectivity for PCSK9. This unexpected potential for small molecules to selectively inhibit the human ribosome opens the possibility for future development of small molecules targeting disease-mediating proteins that were previously thought to be undruggable.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,6,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Lintner","given":"Nathanael G."},{"family":"McClure","given":"Kim F."},{"family":"Petersen","given":"Donna"},{"family":"Londregan","given":"Allyn T."},{"family":"Piotrowski","given":"David W."},{"family":"Wei","given":"Liuqing"},{"family":"Xiao","given":"Jun"},{"family":"Bolt","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Loria","given":"Paula M."},{"family":"Maguire","given":"Bruce"},{"family":"Geoghegan","given":"Kieran F."},{"family":"Huang","given":"Austin"},{"family":"Rolph","given":"Tim"},{"family":"Liras","given":"Spiros"},{"family":"Doudna","given":"Jennifer A."},{"family":"Dullea","given":"Robert G."},{"family":"Cate","given":"Jamie H.

Less is known about how proteins emerging from different polysomes associate to form hetero-oligomeric channels. Here, we report that alternate mRNA transcripts encoding human ether-à-go-go-related gene (hERG) 1a and 1b subunits, which assemble to produce ion channels mediating cardiac repolarization, are physically associated during translation. We show that shRNA specifically targeting either hERG 1a or 1b transcripts reduced levels of both transcripts, but only when they were coexpressed heterologously. Both transcripts could be copurified with an Ab against the nascent hERG 1a N terminus. This interaction occurred even when translation of 1b was prevented, indicating the transcripts associate independent of their encoded proteins. The association was also demonstrated in cardiomyocytes, where levels of both hERG transcripts were reduced by either 1a or 1b shRNA, but native KCNE1 and ryanodine receptor 2 (RYR2) transcripts were unaffected. Changes in protein levels and membrane currents mirrored changes in transcript levels, indicating the targeted transcripts were undergoing translation. The physical association of transcripts encoding different subunits provides the spatial proximity required for nascent proteins to interact during biogenesis, and may represent a general mechanism facilitating assembly of heteromeric protein complexes involved in a range of biological processes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Liu","given":"Fang"},{"family":"Jones","given":"David K."},{"family":"Lange","given":"Willem J.","dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Robertson","given":"Gail A."}],"citation-key":"Liu2016","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1521577113","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"17","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,4,26]]},"language":"en","license":"©  . http://www.pnas.org/preview_site/misc/userlicense.xhtml","page":"4859-4864","PMID":"27078096","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","section":"Biological Sciences","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"Cotranslational association of mRNA encoding subunits of heteromeric ion channels","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/content/113/17/4859","volume":"113"},

  {"id":"Lu2008","abstract":"Electrostatic potentials along the ribosomal exit tunnel are nonuniform and negative. The significance of electrostatics in the tunnel remains relatively uninvestigated, yet they are likely to play a role in translation and secondary folding of nascent peptides. To probe the role of nascent peptide charges in ribosome function, we used a molecular tape measure that was engineered to contain different numbers of charged amino acids localized to known regions of the tunnel and measured chain elongation rates. Positively charged arginine or lysine sequences produce transient arrest (pausing) before the nascent peptide is fully elongated. The rate of conversion from transiently arrested to full-length nascent peptide is faster for peptides containing neutral or negatively charged residues than for those containing positively charged residues. We provide experimental evidence that extraribosomal mechanisms do not account for this charge-specific pausing. We conclude that pausing is due to charge-specific interactions between the tunnel and the nascent peptide.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Lu","given":"Jianli"},{"family":"Deutsch","given":"Carol"}],"citation-key":"Lu2008","container-title":"Journal of Molecular Biology","container-title-short":"Journal of Molecular Biology","DOI":"10.1016/j.jmb.2008.08.089","ISSN":"0022-2836","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,12,5]]},"language":"en","page":"73-86","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Electrostatics in the Ribosomal Tunnel Modulate Chain Elongation Rates","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283608010991","volume":"384"},

This study reports for the first time that rearrangement of the peptide and/or tunnel occurs in distinct regions of the tunnel and is directed by the unique primary sequence of each nascent peptide. In the tunnel mid-region, the accessibility of an introduced cysteine to a series of novel hydrophilic maleimide reagents increases with increasing volume of the adjacent chain residue, a sensitivity not manifest at the constriction and exit port. This surprising result reveals molecular movements not yet resolvable from structural studies.

This growing peptide chain wends its way through the ribosomal tunnel to the exit port, ~100Å from the peptidyl transferase center. We have identified locations in the tunnel that sense and respond to single side chains of the nascent peptide to induce local conformational changes. Moreover, side-chain sterics and rearrangements deep in the tunnel influence the disposition of residues 45Å away at the exit port and are consistent with side-chain-induced axial retraction of the peptide backbone. These coupled responses are neither haphazard nor uniform along the tunnel. Rather, they are confined to discriminating zones in the tunnel and are sequence specific.

  {"id":"Lucent2010","abstract":"As nascent proteins are synthesized by the ribosome, they depart via an exit tunnel running through the center of the large subunit. The exit tunnel likely plays an important part in various aspects of translation. Although water plays a key role in many bio-molecular processes, the nature of water confined to the exit tunnel has remained unknown. Furthermore, solvent in biological cavities has traditionally been characterized as either a continuous dielectric fluid, or a discrete tightly bound molecule. Using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, we predict that the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of water confined within the ribosome exit tunnel are quite different from this simple two-state model. We find that the tunnel creates a complex microenvironment for the solvent resulting in perturbed rotational dynamics and heterogenous dielectric behavior. This gives rise to a very rugged solvation landscape and significantly retarded solvent diffusion. We discuss how this non-bulk-like solvent is likely to affect important biophysical processes such as sequence dependent stalling, co-translational folding, and antibiotic binding. We conclude with a discussion of the general applicability of these results to other biological cavities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Lucent","given":"Del"},{"family":"Snow","given":"Christopher D."},{"family":"Aitken","given":"Colin Echeverría"},{"family":"Pande","given":"Vijay S."}],"citation-key":"Lucent2010","container-title":"PLOS Computational Biology","container-title-short":"PLOS Computational Biology","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000963","ISSN":"1553-7358","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,10,21]]},"language":"en","page":"e1000963","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Non-Bulk-Like Solvent Behavior in the Ribosome Exit Tunnel","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000963","volume":"6"},
  {"id":"Luo1997","abstract":"To establish a framework for extrapolating the helix-forming properties of peptides from TFE/ H2O mixtures (TFE ) 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol) back to water, the thermal unfolding curves have been measured by circular dichroism for four repeating-sequence peptides, with chain lengths from 7 to 22 residues. The unfolding curves were measured between 0 and 50 volume percent TFE and were fitted to the modified Lifson-Roig theory. A single set of helix-coil parameters fits the results for the four peptides at each TFE concentration; only two of the basic helix-coil parameters, <w>, the mean helix propagation parameter of residues in the sequence repeat, and ∆H, the enthalpy change per residue on unfolding the helix, are allowed to vary with TFE molarity. The success in fitting these curves over a wide range of experimental variables shows that helix formation is basically the same in TFE/H2O mixtures as in water. Moreover, a simple model based on a linear dependence of ln <w> and ∆H on TFE molarity can be used to extrapolate the results from 25% TFE (approximately 4 M) back to water. The results also give curves of helix formation induced by TFE at constant temperature, and the properties of these helix induction curves explain some of the puzzling results shown by other peptides in the literature. The average helix propensity increases regularly from 0 to 25% TFE but levels off at higher TFE concentrations, which explains why the extent of helix formation levels off in this range. The change in the apparent cooperativity of thermal unfolding curves in concentrated TFE solutions results from the decrease of the enthalpy change for helix unfolding at higher TFE concentrations. The rapid decrease in the plateau values of apparent helix content with increasing temperature results mainly from the strong temperature dependence of the ellipticity of the complete helix. To determine whether the helix-stabilizing effect of TFE arises from strengthening the hydrogen bonds in the helix backbone, the strength of the hydrogen bond in a model compound, salicylic acid, has been measured in TFE/H2O mixtures from the pKa difference between salicylic acid and a similar compound which cannot form the hydrogen bond. The curve of hydrogen bond strength versus increasing TFE concentration matches both in shape and magnitude the increase in average helix propensity in TFE/H2O mixtures.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Luo","given":"Peizhi"},{"family":"Baldwin","given":"Robert L."}],"citation-key":"Luo1997","container-title":"Biochemistry","container-title-short":"Biochemistry","DOI":"10.1021/bi9707133","ISSN":"0006-2960, 1520-4995","issue":"27","issued":{"date-parts":[[1997,7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"8413-8421","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Mechanism of Helix Induction by Trifluoroethanol: A Framework for Extrapolating the Helix-Forming Properties of Peptides from Trifluoroethanol/Water Mixtures Back to Water","title-short":"Mechanism of Helix Induction by Trifluoroethanol","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/bi9707133","volume":"36"},
  {"id":"Machkovech2019","abstract":"Translation can initiate at alternate, non-canonical start codons in response to stressful stimuli in mammalian cells. Recent studies suggest that viral infection and anti-viral responses alter sites of translation initiation, and in some cases, lead to production of novel immune epitopes. Here we systematically investigate the extent and impact of alternate translation initiation in cells infected with influenza virus. We perform evolutionary analyses that suggest selection against non-canonical initiation at CUG codons in influenza virus lineages that have adapted to mammalian hosts. We then use ribosome profiling with the initiation inhibitor lactimidomycin to experimentally delineate translation initiation sites in a human lung epithelial cell line infected with influenza virus. We identify several candidate sites of alternate initiation in influenza mRNAs, all of which occur at AUG codons that are downstream of canonical initiation codons. One of these candidate downstream start sites truncates 14 amino acids from the N-terminus of the N1 neuraminidase protein, resulting in loss of its cytoplasmic tail and a portion of the transmembrane domain. This truncated neuraminidase protein is expressed on the cell surface during influenza virus infection, is enzymatically active, and is conserved in most N1 viral lineages. We do not detect globally higher levels of alternate translation initiation on host transcripts upon influenza infection or during the anti-viral response, but the subset of host transcripts induced by the anti-viral response is enriched for alternate initiation sites. Together, our results systematically map the landscape of translation initiation during influenza virus infection, and shed light on the evolutionary forces shaping this landscape.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Machkovech","given":"Heather M."},{"family":"Bloom","given":"Jesse D."},{"family":"Subramaniam","given":"Arvind R."}],"citation-key":"Machkovech2019","container-title":"PLOS Pathogens","container-title-short":"PLOS Pathogens","DOI":"10.1371/journal.ppat.1007518","ISSN":"1553-7374","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,1,23]]},"language":"en","page":"e1007518","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Comprehensive profiling of translation initiation in influenza virus infected cells","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1007518","volume":"15"},

Recent studies have revealed that codon composition in the open reading frame (ORF) determines mRNA stability in multiple organisms.

However, complementary experimental analysis is required to define the codon effects on mRNA stability apart from the related cotranslational mRNA decay pathways such as those triggered by aberrant ribosome stalls. In the current study, we performed a set of reporter-based analyses to define codon-mediated mRNA decay and ribosome stall-dependent mRNA decay in zebrafish embryos.

This included designing better methods for the successful delivery of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) into mammalian cells. While the simplest method for RNAi is the cytosolic delivery of siRNA oligonucleotides, this technique is limited to cells capable of transfection and is primarily utilized during transient in vitro studies. The introduction of shRNA into mammalian cells through infection with viral vectors allows for stable integration of shRNA and long-term knockdown of the targeted gene; however, several challenges exist with the implementation of this technology. Here we describe some well-tested protocols which should increase the chances of successful design, delivery, and assessment of gene knockdown by shRNA. We provide suggestions for designing shRNA targets and controls, a protocol for sequencing through the secondary structure of the shRNA hairpin structure, and protocols for packaging and delivery of shRNA lentiviral particles. Using real-time PCR and functional assays we demonstrate the successful knockdown of ASC, an inflammatory adaptor molecule. These studies demonstrate the practicality of including two shRNAs with different efficacies of knockdown to provide an additional level of control and to verify dose dependency of functional effects. Along with the methods described here, as new techniques and algorithms are designed in the future, shRNA is likely to include further promising application and continue to be a critical component of gene discovery.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Moore","given":"Chris B."},{"family":"Guthrie","given":"Elizabeth H."},{"family":"Huang","given":"Max Tze-Han"},{"family":"Taxman","given":"Debra J."}],"citation-key":"Moore2010","container-title":"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)","container-title-short":"Methods Mol Biol","DOI":"10.1007/978-1-60761-657-3_10","ISSN":"1064-3745","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]},"page":"141-158","PMCID":"PMC3679364","PMID":"20387148","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Short Hairpin RNA (shRNA): Design, Delivery, and Assessment of Gene Knockdown","title-short":"Short Hairpin RNA (shRNA)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3679364/","volume":"629"},

Here, we measured the effects of splicing on expression in a panel of synonymous reporter genes that varied in nucleotide composition. We found that high GC content increased protein yield, mRNA yield, cytoplasmic mRNA localization, and translation of unspliced reporters. Splicing did not affect the expression of GC-rich variants. However, splicing promoted the expression of AT-rich variants by increasing their steady-state protein and mRNA levels, in part through promoting cytoplasmic localization of mRNA.

  {"id":"Mori2018","abstract":"VemP (Vibrio protein export monitoring polypeptide) is a secretory protein comprising 159 amino acid residues, which functions as a secretion monitor in Vibrio and regulates expression of the downstream V.secDF2 genes. When VemP export is compromised, its translation specifically undergoes elongation arrest at the position where the Gln156 codon of vemP encounters the P-site in the translating ribosome, resulting in up-regulation of V.SecDF2 production. Although our previous study suggests that many residues in a highly conserved C-terminal 20-residue region of VemP contribute to its elongation arrest, the exact role of each residue remains unclear. Here, we constructed a reporter system to easily and exactly monitor the in vivo arrest efficiency of VemP. Using this reporter system, we systematically performed a mutational analysis of the 20 residues (His138–Phe157) to identify and characterize the arrest motif. Our results show that 15 residues in the conserved region participate in elongation arrest and that multiple interactions between important residues in VemP and in the interior of the exit tunnel contribute to the elongation arrest of VemP. The arrangement of these important residues induced by specific secondary structures in the ribosomal tunnel is critical for the arrest. Pro scanning analysis of the preceding segment (Met120–Phe137) revealed a minor role of this region in the arrest.

Here we report a statistical determination of α-helix and β-strand propensities derived from the analysis of a database of 279 three-dimensional structures. Contrary to what has been generally done, we have considered a particular residue as in α-helix or β-strand conformation by looking only at its dihedral angles (ϕ–ψ matrices). Neither the identity nor the conformation of the surrounding residues in the amino acid sequence has been taken into consideration. Pseudoenergy empirical scales have been calculated from the statistical propensities. These scales agree very well with the experimental ones in relative and absolute terms. Moreover, its correlation with the average of the experimental scales for α-helix or β-strand is as good as the correlations of the individual experimental scales with the average. These results show that by using a large enough database and a proper definition for the secondary structure propensities, it is possible to obtain a scale as good as any of experimental origin.

The method is designed for model validation to estimate the error of a given protein structural model based on the measured CD spectrum. We compared the predictive power of our method to that of existing algorithms, namely, DichroCalc and PDB2CD, and found that it predicts CD spectra more accurately. Our results indicate that the derived basis sets are robust to both experimental errors in the reference spectra and the choice of the secondary structure classiﬁcation algorithm. For over 80% of the globular reference proteins, our basis sets accurately predict the experimental spectrum solely from their secondary structure composition.

  {"id":"Narula2019","abstract":"A new paradigm has emerged that coding regions can regulate mRNA stability in model organisms. Here, due to differences in cognate tRNA abundance, synonymous codons are translated at different speeds, and slow codons then stimulate mRNA decay. To ask if this phenomenon also occurs in humans, we isolated RNA stability effects due to coding regions using the human ORFeome collection. We find that many ORF characteristics, such as length and secondary structure, fail to provide explanations for how coding regions alter mRNA stability, and, instead, that the ORF relies on translation to impact mRNA stability. Consistent with what has been seen in other organisms, codon use is related to the effects of ORFs on transcript stability. Importantly, we found instabilityassociated codons have longer A-site dwell times, suggesting for the first time in humans a connection between elongation speed and mRNA decay. Thus, we propose that codon usage alters decoding speeds and so affects human mRNA stability.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Narula","given":"Ashrut"},{"family":"Ellis","given":"James"},{"family":"Taliaferro","given":"J.

The E. coli exit tunnel has evidently evolved to minimize interaction with the exit tunnel and maximize the sequence diversity of the proteome, although allowing some interactions for regulatory purposes.

In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the key determinants of translation elongation. We discuss consequences of ribosome stalling or collision, and how the cells regulate translation in case of such events.

Introns and the act of their removal by the spliceosome can affect gene expression at many different levels, including transcription, polyadenylation, mRNA export, translational efficiency, and the rate of mRNA decay. However, the extent to which each of these steps contributes to the overall effect of any one intron on gene expression has not been rigorously tested. Here we report construction and initial characterization of a luciferase-based reporter system for monitoring the effects of individual introns and their position within the gene on protein expression in mammalian cells. Quantitative analysis of constructs containing human TPI intron 6 at two different positions within the Renilla luciferase open reading frame revealed that this intron acts primarily to enhance mRNA accumulation. Spliced mRNAs also exhibited higher translational yields than did intronless transcripts. However, nucleocytoplasmic mRNA distribution and mRNA stability were largely unaffected.

  {"id":"OBrien2011","abstract":"Identifying and understanding the differences between protein folding in bulk solution and in the cell is a crucial challenge facing biology. Using Langevin dynamics, we have simulated intact ribosomes containing five different nascent chains arrested at different stages of their synthesis such that each nascent chain can fold and unfold at or near the exit tunnel vestibule. We find that the native state is destabilized close to the ribosome surface due to an increase in unfolded state entropy and a decrease in native state entropy; the former arises because the unfolded ensemble tends to behave as an expanded random coil near the ribosome and a semicompact globule in bulk solution. In addition, the unfolded ensemble of the nascent chain adopts a highly anisotropic shape near the ribosome surface and the cooperativity of the folding-unfolding transition is decreased due to the appearance of partially folded structures that are not populated in bulk solution. The results show, in light of these effects, that with increasing nascent chain length folding rates increase in a linear manner and unfolding rates decrease, with larger and topologically more complex folds being the most highly perturbed by the ribosome. Analysis of folding trajectories, initiated by temperature quench, reveals the transition state ensemble is driven toward compaction and greater native-like structure by interactions with the ribosome surface and exit vestibule. Furthermore, the diversity of folding pathways decreases and the probability increases of initiating folding via the N-terminus on the ribosome. We show that all of these findings are equally applicable to the situation in which protein folding occurs during continuous (non-arrested) translation provided that the time scales of folding and unfolding are much faster than the time scale of monomer addition to the growing nascent chain, which results in a quasi-equilibrium process. These substantial ribosome-induced perturbations to almost all aspects of protein folding indicate that folding scenarios that are distinct from those of bulk solution can occur on the ribosome.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,13]]},"author":[{"family":"O’Brien","given":"Edward P."},{"family":"Christodoulou","given":"John"},{"family":"Vendruscolo","given":"Michele"},{"family":"Dobson","given":"Christopher M."}],"citation-key":"OBrien2011","container-title":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","container-title-short":"J.

Contrary to this model, we find that increasing initiation rate can decrease both protein expression and stability of certain mRNAs in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These mRNAs encode a stretch of polybasic residues that cause ribosome stalling. Our computational modeling predicts that the observed decrease in gene expression at high initiation rates occurs when ribosome collisions at stalls stimulate abortive termination of the leading ribosome or cause endonucleolytic mRNA cleavage. Consistent with this prediction, the collision-associated qualitycontrol factors Asc1 and Hel2 (orthologs of human RACK1 and ZNF598, respectively) decrease gene expression from stall-containing mRNAs only at high initiation rates. Remarkably, hundreds of S. cerevisiae mRNAs that contain ribosome stall sequences also exhibit lower translation efficiency.

However, the mechanisms underlying their expression are not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate that ZNF598, the rate-limiting factor for ribosome-associated quality control (RQC), co-translationally titrates the expression of C9ORF72-derived poly(GR) protein. A Drosophila genetic screen identiﬁed key RQC factors as potent modiﬁers of poly(GR)-induced neurodegeneration. ZNF598 overexpression in human neuroblastoma cells inhibited the nuclear accumulation of poly(GR) protein and decreased its cytotoxicity, whereas ZNF598 deletion had opposing effects. Poly(GR)-encoding sequences in the reporter RNAs caused translational stalling and generated ribosome-associated translation products, sharing molecular signatures with canonical RQC substrates. Furthermore, ZNF598 and listerin 1, the RQC E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, promoted poly(GR) degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. An ALS-relevant ZNF598R69C mutant displayed lossof-function effects on poly(GR) expression, as well as on general RQC. Moreover, RQC function was impaired in C9-ALS patient-derived neurons, whereas lentiviral overexpression of ZNF598 lowered their poly(GR) expression and suppressed proapoptotic caspase-3 activation. Taken together, we propose that an adaptive nature of the RQC-relevant ZNF598 activity allows the co-translational surveillance to cope with the atypical expression of pathogenic poly(GR) protein, thereby acquiring a neuroprotective function in C9-ALS/FTD.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Park","given":"Jumin"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Jongbo"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Ji-hyung"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Jongbin"},{"family":"Park","given":"Heeju"},{"family":"Lim","given":"Chunghun"}],"citation-key":"Park2021","container-title":"Nucleic Acids Research","DOI":"10.1093/nar/gkab834","ISSN":"0305-1048, 1362-4962","issue":"19","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,8]]},"language":"en","page":"11294-11311","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"ZNF598 co-translationally titrates poly(GR) protein implicated in the pathogenesis of <i>C9ORF72</i> -associated ALS/FTD","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/49/19/11294/6374173","volume":"49"},

  {"id":"Pechmann2012","abstract":"The choice of codons can influence local translation kinetics during protein synthesis. Whether codon preference is linked to cotranslational regulation of polypeptide folding remains unclear. Here, we derive a revised translational efficiency scale that incorporates the competition between tRNA supply and demand. Applying this scale to ten closely related yeast species, we uncover the evolutionary conservation of codon optimality in eukaryotes. This analysis reveals universal patterns of conserved optimal and nonoptimal codons, often in clusters, which associate with the secondary structure of the translated polypeptides independent of the levels of expression. Our analysis suggests an evolved function for codon optimality in regulating the rhythm of elongation to facilitate cotranslational polypeptide folding, beyond its previously proposed role of adapting to the cost of expression. These findings establish how mRNA sequences are generally under selection to optimize the cotranslational folding of corresponding polypeptides.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2013,1,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Pechmann","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Frydman","given":"Judith"}],"citation-key":"Pechmann2012","container-title":"Nature Structural & Molecular Biology","DOI":"10.1038/nsmb.2466","ISSN":"1545-9993","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2012 Nature Publishing Group, a division of Macmillan Publishers Limited.

  {"id":"Peter2017","abstract":"The eIF4E homologous protein (4EHP) is thought to repress translation by competing with eIF4E for binding to the 5′ cap structure of specific mRNAs to which it is recruited through interactions with various proteins, including the GRB10-interacting GYF (glycine–tyrosine–phenylalanine domain) proteins 1 and 2 (GIGYF1/2). Despite its similarity to eIF4E, 4EHP does not interact with eIF4G and therefore fails to initiate translation. In contrast to eIF4G, GIGYF1/2 bind selectively to 4EHP but not eIF4E. Here, we present crystal structures of the 4EHP-binding regions of GIGYF1 and GIGYF2 in complex with 4EHP, which reveal the molecular basis for the selectivity of the GIGYF1/2 proteins for 4EHP. Complementation assays in a GIGYF1/2-null cell line using structure-based mutants indicate that 4EHP requires interactions with GIGYF1/2 to down-regulate target mRNA expression. Our studies provide structural insights into the assembly of 4EHP–GIGYF1/2 repressor complexes and reveal that rather than merely facilitating 4EHP recruitment to transcripts, GIGYF1/2 proteins are required for repressive activity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Peter","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Weber","given":"Ramona"},{"family":"Sandmeir","given":"Felix"},{"family":"Wohlbold","given":"Lara"},{"family":"Helms","given":"Sigrun"},{"family":"Bawankar","given":"Praveen"},{"family":"Valkov","given":"Eugene"},{"family":"Igreja","given":"Cátia"},{"family":"Izaurralde","given":"Elisa"}],"citation-key":"Peter2017","container-title":"Genes & Development","container-title-short":"Genes Dev.","DOI":"10.1101/gad.299420.117","ISSN":"0890-9369, 1549-5477","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1147-1161","PMID":"28698298","publisher":"Cold Spring Harbor Lab","source":"genesdev.cshlp.org","title":"GIGYF1/2 proteins use auxiliary sequences to selectively bind to 4EHP and repress target mRNA expression","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/31/11/1147","volume":"31"},

New proteins emerge from the ribosome through an exit tunnel as nascent polypeptide chains. Recent findings indicate that tunnel interactions with the nascent polypeptide chain might be relevant for the regulation of translation. However, the specific ribosomal structural features that mediate this process are unknown. Performing molecular dynamics simulations, we are studying the interactions between components of the ribosome exit tunnel and different chemical probes (specifically different amino acid side chains or monovalent inorganic ions). Our free-energy maps describe the physicochemical environment of the tunnel, revealing binding crevices and free-energy barriers for single amino acids and ions. Our simulations indicate that transport out of the tunnel could be different for diverse amino acid species. In addition, our results predict a notable protein–RNA interaction between a flexible 23S rRNA tetraloop (gate) and ribosomal protein L39 (latch) that could potentially obstruct the tunnel's exit. By relating our simulation data to earlier biochemical studies, we propose that ribosomal features at the exit of the tunnel can play a role in the regulation of nascent chain exit and ion flux. Moreover, our free-energy maps may provide a context for interpreting sequence-dependent nascent chain phenomenology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Petrone","given":"Paula M."},{"family":"Snow","given":"Christopher D."},{"family":"Lucent","given":"Del"},{"family":"Pande","given":"Vijay S."}],"citation-key":"Petrone2008","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.0801795105","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"43","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,10,28]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA","page":"16549-16554","PMID":"18946046","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","section":"Biological Sciences","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"Side-chain recognition and gating in the ribosome exit tunnel","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/content/105/43/16549","volume":"105"},

Aberrant protein biogenesis can result in cellular toxicity and disease, with membrane-embedded proteins being particularly challenging for the cell. In order to protect the cell from consequences of defects in membrane proteins, quality control systems act to maintain protein homeostasis. The majority of these pathways act post-translationally; however, recent evidence reveals that membrane proteins are also subject to co-translational quality control during their synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This newly identified quality control pathway employs components of the cytosolic ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) machinery but differs from canonical RQC in that it responds to biogenesis state of the substrate rather than mRNA aberrations. This ER-associated RQC (ER-RQC) is sensitive to membrane protein misfolding and malfunctions in the ER insertion machinery. In this Review, we discuss the advantages of co-translational quality control of membrane proteins, as well as potential mechanisms of substrate recognition and degradation. Finally, we discuss some outstanding questions concerning future studies of ER-RQC of membrane proteins.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Phillips","given":"Ben P."},{"family":"Miller","given":"Elizabeth A."}],"citation-key":"Phillips2020","container-title":"Journal of Cell Science","container-title-short":"J Cell Sci","DOI":"10.1242/jcs.251983","ISSN":"0021-9533, 1477-9137","issue":"22","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,15]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2020.

Previous studies have identified dynamic changes in the tRNA supply and mRNA demand during cancerous proliferation. Yet, dynamic changes may occur also during physiologically normal proliferation, and these are less characterized. We examined the tRNA and mRNA pools of T-cells during their vigorous proliferation and differentiation upon triggering of the T cell antigen receptor. We observe a global signature of switch in demand for codon at the early proliferation phase of the response, accompanied by corresponding changes in tRNA expression levels. In the later phase, upon differentiation of the T cells, the response of the tRNA pool is relaxed back to basal level, potentially restraining excessive proliferation. Sequencing of tRNAs allowed us to also evaluate their diverse base-modifications. We found that two types of tRNA modifications, Wybutosine and ms2t6A, are reduced dramatically during T-cell activation. These modifications occur in the anti-codon loops of two tRNAs that decode slippery codons, that are prone to ribosomal frameshifting. Attenuation of these frameshift-protective modifications is expected to increase proteome-wide frameshifting during T-cell proliferation. Indeed, human cell lines deleted of a Wybutosine writer showed increased ribosomal frameshifting, as detected with a reporter that consists of a critical frameshifting site taken from the HIV gag-pol slippery codon motif. These results may explain HIV specificity to proliferating T-Cells since it requires ribosomal frameshift exactly on this codon for infection.

  {"id":"Ramu2011","abstract":"Summary\nThe ability to monitor the nascent peptide structure and to respond functionally to specific nascent peptide sequences is a fundamental property of the ribosome. An extreme manifestation of such response is nascent peptide-dependent ribosome stalling, involved in the regulation of gene expression. The molecular mechanisms of programmed translation arrest are unclear. By analyzing ribosome stalling at the regulatory cistron of the antibiotic resistance gene ermA, we uncovered a carefully orchestrated cooperation between the ribosomal exit tunnel and the A-site of the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) in halting translation. The presence of an inducing antibiotic and a specific nascent peptide in the exit tunnel abrogate the ability of the PTC to catalyze peptide bond formation with a particular subset of amino acids. The extent of the conferred A-site selectivity is modulated by the C-terminal segment of the nascent peptide, where the third-from-last residue plays a critical role.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,5,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Ramu","given":"Haripriya"},{"family":"Vázquez-Laslop","given":"Nora"},{"family":"Klepacki","given":"Dorota"},{"family":"Dai","given":"Qing"},{"family":"Piccirilli","given":"Joseph"},{"family":"Micura","given":"Ronald"},{"family":"Mankin","given":"Alexander S."}],"citation-key":"Ramu2011","container-title":"Molecular Cell","container-title-short":"Molecular Cell","DOI":"10.1016/j.molcel.2010.12.031","ISSN":"1097-2765","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,2,4]]},"page":"321-330","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Nascent Peptide in the Ribosome Exit Tunnel Affects Functional Properties of the A-Site of the Peptidyl Transferase Center","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276510010403","volume":"41"},

  {"id":"Renton2011","abstract":"The chromosome 9p21 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-frontotemporal dementia (ALS-FTD) locus contains one of the last major unidentiﬁed autosomal-dominant genes underlying these common neurodegenerative diseases. We have previously shown that a founder haplotype, covering the MOBKL2b, IFNK, and C9ORF72 genes, is present in the majority of cases linked to this region. Here we show that there is a large hexanucleotide (GGGGCC) repeat expansion in the ﬁrst intron of C9ORF72 on the affected haplotype. This repeat expansion segregates perfectly with disease in the Finnish population, underlying 46.0% of familial ALS and 21.1% of sporadic ALS in that population. Taken together with the D90A SOD1 mutation, 87% of familial ALS in Finland is now explained by a simple monogenic cause. The repeat expansion is also present in onethird of familial ALS cases of outbred European descent, making it the most common genetic cause of these fatal neurodegenerative diseases identiﬁed to date.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Renton","given":"Alan E."},{"family":"Majounie","given":"Elisa"},{"family":"Waite","given":"Adrian"},{"family":"Simón-Sánchez","given":"Javier"},{"family":"Rollinson","given":"Sara"},{"family":"Gibbs","given":"J. Raphael"},{"family":"Schymick","given":"Jennifer C."},{"family":"Laaksovirta","given":"Hannu"},{"family":"van Swieten","given":"John C."},{"family":"Myllykangas","given":"Liisa"},{"family":"Kalimo","given":"Hannu"},{"family":"Paetau","given":"Anders"},{"family":"Abramzon","given":"Yevgeniya"},{"family":"Remes","given":"Anne M."},{"family":"Kaganovich","given":"Alice"},{"family":"Scholz","given":"Sonja W."},{"family":"Duckworth","given":"Jamie"},{"family":"Ding","given":"Jinhui"},{"family":"Harmer","given":"Daniel W."},{"family":"Hernandez","given":"Dena G."},{"family":"Johnson","given":"Janel O."},{"family":"Mok","given":"Kin"},{"family":"Ryten","given":"Mina"},{"family":"Trabzuni","given":"Danyah"},{"family":"Guerreiro","given":"Rita J."},{"family":"Orrell","given":"Richard W."},{"family":"Neal","given":"James"},{"family":"Murray","given":"Alex"},{"family":"Pearson","given":"Justin"},{"family":"Jansen","given":"Iris E."},{"family":"Sondervan","given":"David"},{"family":"Seelaar","given":"Harro"},{"family":"Blake","given":"Derek"},{"family":"Young","given":"Kate"},{"family":"Halliwell","given":"Nicola"},{"family":"Callister","given":"Janis Bennion"},{"family":"Toulson","given":"Greg"},{"family":"Richardson","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Gerhard","given":"Alex"},{"family":"Snowden","given":"Julie"},{"family":"Mann","given":"David"},{"family":"Neary","given":"David"},{"family":"Nalls","given":"Michael A."},{"family":"Peuralinna","given":"Terhi"},{"family":"Jansson","given":"Lilja"},{"family":"Isoviita","given":"Veli-Matti"},{"family":"Kaivorinne","given":"Anna-Lotta"},{"family":"Hölttä-Vuori","given":"Maarit"},{"family":"Ikonen","given":"Elina"},{"family":"Sulkava","given":"Raimo"},{"family":"Benatar","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Wuu","given":"Joanne"},{"family":"Chiò","given":"Adriano"},{"family":"Restagno","given":"Gabriella"},{"family":"Borghero","given":"Giuseppe"},{"family":"Sabatelli","given":"Mario"},{"family":"Heckerman","given":"David"},{"family":"Rogaeva","given":"Ekaterina"},{"family":"Zinman","given":"Lorne"},{"family":"Rothstein","given":"Jeffrey D."},{"family":"Sendtner","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Drepper","given":"Carsten"},{"family":"Eichler","given":"Evan E."},{"family":"Alkan","given":"Can"},{"family":"Abdullaev","given":"Ziedulla"},{"family":"Pack","given":"Svetlana D."},{"family":"Dutra","given":"Amalia"},{"family":"Pak","given":"Evgenia"},{"family":"Hardy","given":"John"},{"family":"Singleton","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Williams","given":"Nigel M."},{"family":"Heutink","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Pickering-Brown","given":"Stuart"},{"family":"Morris","given":"Huw R."},{"family":"Tienari","given":"Pentti J."},{"family":"Traynor","given":"Bryan J."}],"citation-key":"Renton2011","container-title":"Neuron","container-title-short":"Neuron","DOI":"10.1016/j.neuron.2011.09.010","ISSN":"08966273","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,10]]},"language":"en","page":"257-268","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A Hexanucleotide Repeat Expansion in C9ORF72 Is the Cause of Chromosome 9p21-Linked ALS-FTD","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0896627311007975","volume":"72"},
  {"id":"Requiao2016","abstract":"It has been proposed that polybasic peptides cause slower movement of ribosomes through an electrostatic interaction with the highly negative ribosome exit tunnel. Ribosome proﬁling data—the sequencing of short ribosome-bound fragments of mRNA—is a powerful tool for the analysis of mRNA translation. Using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model, we showed that reduced translation efﬁciency associated with polybasic protein sequences could be inferred from ribosome proﬁling. However, an increase in ribosome density at polybasic sequences was evident only when the commonly used translational inhibitors cycloheximide and anisomycin were omitted during mRNA isolation. Since ribosome proﬁling performed without inhibitors agrees with experimental evidence obtained by other methods, we conclude that cycloheximide and anisomycin must be avoided in ribosome proﬁling experiments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Requião","given":"Rodrigo D."},{"family":"Souza","given":"Henrique José Araujo","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Rossetto","given":"Silvana"},{"family":"Domitrovic","given":"Tatiana"},{"family":"Palhano","given":"Fernando L."}],"citation-key":"Requiao2016","container-title":"RNA Biology","container-title-short":"RNA Biology","DOI":"10.1080/15476286.2016.1172755","ISSN":"1547-6286, 1555-8584","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,6,2]]},"language":"en","page":"561-568","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Increased ribosome density associated to positively charged residues is evident in ribosome profiling experiments performed in the absence of translation inhibitors","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15476286.2016.1172755","volume":"13"},
  {"id":"Reynolds1996","abstract":"Regulation of mRNA translation and stability plays an important role in the control of gene expression during embryonic development. We have recently shown that the tissue-specific expression of the RAR beta 2 gene in mouse embryos is regulated at the translational level by short upstream open reading frames (uORFs) In the 5'-untranslated region (Zimmer, A., A.M. Zimmer, and K. Reynolds. 1994. J. Cell Biol. 127:1111-1119). To gain insight into the molecular mechanism, we have performed a systematic mutational analysis of the uORFs. Two series of constructs were tested: in one series, each uORF was individually inactivated by introducing a point mutation in its start codon; in the second series, all but one ORF were inactivated. Our results indicate that individual uORFs may have different functions. uORF4 seems to inhibit translation of the major ORF in heart and brain, while uORFs 2 and 5 appear to be important for efficient translation in all tissues. To determine whether the polypeptide encoded by uORF4 or the act of translating it, is the significant event, we introduced point mutations to create silent mutations or amino acid substitutions in uORF4. Our results indicate that the uORF4 amino acid coding sequence is important for the inhibitory effect on translation of the downstream major ORF.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Reynolds","given":"K"},{"family":"Zimmer","given":"A M"},{"family":"Zimmer","given":"A"}],"citation-key":"Reynolds1996","container-title":"Journal of Cell Biology","container-title-short":"Journal of Cell Biology","DOI":"10.1083/jcb.134.4.827","ISSN":"0021-9525","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[1996,8,15]]},"page":"827-835","source":"Silverchair","title":"Regulation of RAR beta 2 mRNA expression: evidence for an inhibitory peptide encoded in the 5'-untranslated region.","title-short":"Regulation of RAR beta 2 mRNA expression","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.134.4.827","volume":"134"},

  {"id":"Ripke2014","abstract":"Schizophrenia is a highly heritable disorder. Genetic risk is conferred by a large number of alleles, including common alleles of small effect that might be detected by genome-wide association studies. Here we report a multi-stage schizophrenia genome-wide association study of up to 36,989 cases and 113,075 controls. We identify 128 independent associations spanning 108 conservatively defined loci that meet genome-wide significance, 83 of which have not been previously reported. Associations were enriched among genes expressed in brain, providing biological plausibility for the findings. Many findings have the potential to provide entirely new insights into aetiology, but associations at DRD2 and several genes involved in glutamatergic neurotransmission highlight molecules of known and potential therapeutic relevance to schizophrenia, and are consistent with leading pathophysiological hypotheses. Independent of genes expressed in brain, associations were enriched among genes expressed in tissues that have important roles in immunity, providing support for the speculated link between the immune system and schizophrenia.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Ripke","given":"Stephan"},{"family":"Neale","given":"Benjamin M."},{"family":"Corvin","given":"Aiden"},{"family":"Walters","given":"James T.

  {"id":"Robinson2005","abstract":"Acquisition of secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structure is critical to the fabrication, assembly, and function of ion channels, yet the relationship between these biogenic events remains unclear. We now address this issue in voltage-gated K+ channels (Kv) for the T1 domain, an N-terminal Kv recognition domain that is responsible for subfamily-specific, efficient assembly of Kv subunits. This domain forms a 4-fold symmetric tetramer. We have identified residues along the axial T1-T1 interface that are critical for tertiary and quaternary structure, shown that mutations at one end of the axial T1 interface can perturb the crosslinking of an intersubunit cysteine pair at the other end, and demonstrated that tertiary folding and tetramerization of this Kv domain are coupled. A threshold level of tertiary folding is required for monomers to oligomerize. Coupling between tertiary and quaternary structure formation may be a common feature in the biogenesis of multimeric proteins.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Robinson","given":"John M."},{"family":"Deutsch","given":"Carol"}],"citation-key":"Robinson2005","container-title":"Neuron","container-title-short":"Neuron","DOI":"10.1016/j.neuron.2004.12.043","ISSN":"0896-6273","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2005,1,20]]},"language":"en","page":"223-232","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Coupled Tertiary Folding and Oligomerization of the T1 Domain of Kv Channels","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627304008529","volume":"45"},
  {"id":"Sabatini1970","abstract":"Rough microsomes were incubated in an in vitro amino acid-incorporating system for labeling the nascent polypeptide chains on the membrane-bound ribosomes. Sucrose density gradient analysis showed that ribosomes did not detach from the membranes during incorporation in vitro. Trypsin and chymotrypsin treatment of microsomes at 0° led to the detachment of ribosomes from the membranes; furthermore, trypsin produced the dissociation of released, messenger RNA-free ribosomes into subunits. Electron microscopic observations indicated that the membranes remained as closed vesicles. In contrast to the situation with free polysomes, nascent chains contained in rough microsomes were extensively protected from proteolytic attach. By separating the microsomal membranes from the released subunits after proteolysis, it was found that nascent chains are split into two size classes of fragments when the ribosomes are detached. These were shown by column chromatography on Sephadex G-50 to be: (a) small (39 amino acid residues) ribosome-associated fragments and (b) a mixture of larger membrane-associated fragments excluded from the column. The small fragments correspond to the carboxy-terminal segments which are protected by the large subunits of free polysomes. The larger fragments associated with the microsomal membranes depend for their protection on membrane integrity. These fragments are completely digested if the microsomes are subjected to proteolysis in the presence of detergents. These results indicate that when the nascent polypeptides growing in the large subunits of membrane-bound ribosomes emerge from the ribosomes they enter directly into a close association with the microsomal membrane.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Sabatini","given":"D.

  {"id":"Sabi2017","abstract":"Interactions between the ribosomal exit tunnel and the nascent peptide can affect translation elongation rates. While previous studies have already demonstrated the feasibility of such interactions, little is known about the nature of the stalling peptide sequences and their distribution in the proteome. Here we ask which peptide sequences tend to occupy the tunnel of stalled ribosomes and how they are distributed in the proteome. Using computational analysis of ribosome profiling data from S. cerevisiae, we identified for the first time dozens of short stalling peptide sequences and studied their statistical properties. We found that short peptide sequences associated with ribosome stalling tend significantly to be either over- or underrepresented in the proteome. We then showed that the stalling interactions may occur at different positions along the length of the tunnel, prominently close to the P-site. Our findings throw light on the determinants of nascent peptide-mediated ribosome stalling during translation elongation and support the novel conjecture that mRNA translation affects the proteomic distribution of short peptide sequences.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,12,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Sabi","given":"Renana"},{"family":"Tuller","given":"Tamir"}],"citation-key":"Sabi2017","container-title":"RNA","container-title-short":"RNA","DOI":"10.1261/rna.059188.116","ISSN":"1355-8382, 1469-9001","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"983-994","PMID":"28363900","source":"rnajournal.cshlp.org","title":"Computational analysis of nascent peptides that induce ribosome stalling and their proteomic distribution in Saccharomyces cerevisiae","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://rnajournal.cshlp.org/content/23/7/983","volume":"23"},
  {"id":"Sahakyan2020","abstract":"<h3>Abstract</h3> <p>Proteins fold robustly and reproducibly in vivo, but many cannot fold in vitro in isolation from cellular components. The pathways to proteins’ native conformations, either in vitro or in vivo, remain largely unknown. The slow progress in recapitulating protein folding pathways in silico may be an indication of the fundamental deficiencies in our understanding of folding as it occurs in nature. Here we consider the possibility that protein folding in living cells may not be driven solely by the decrease in Gibbs free energy and propose that protein folding in vivo should be modeled as an active energy-dependent process. The mechanism of action of such protein folding machine might include direct manipulation of the peptide backbone. To show the feasibility of a protein folding machine, we conducted molecular dynamics simulations that were augmented by the application of mechanical force to rotate the C-terminal amino acid while simultaneously limiting the N-terminal amino acid movements. Remarkably, the introduction of this simple manipulation of peptide backbones to the standard molecular dynamics simulation indeed facilitated the formation of native structures in five diverse alpha-helical peptides. Such effect may play a role during co-translational protein folding in vivo: considering the rotating motion of the tRNA 3’-end in the peptidyltransferase center of the ribosome, it is possible that this motion might introduce rotation to the nascent peptide and influence the peptide’s folding pathway in a way similar to what was observed in our simulations.</p>","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Sahakyan","given":"Harutyun K."},{"family":"Nazaryan","given":"Karen B."},{"family":"Mushegian","given":"Arcady R."},{"family":"Sorokina","given":"Irina N."}],"citation-key":"Sahakyan2020","container-title":"bioRxiv","DOI":"10.1101/2020.09.01.277582","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,18]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2020, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

  {"id":"Sauter2010","abstract":"Doxorubicin is an anthracycline drug that is one of the most effective and widely used anticancer agents for the treatment of both hematologic and solid tumors. The stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs) are frequently activated by a number of cancer chemotherapeutics. When phosphorylated, the SAPKs initiate a cascade that leads to the production of proinflammatory cytokines. Some inhibitors of protein synthesis, known as ribotoxic stressors, coordinately activate SAPKs and lead to apoptotic cell death. We demonstrate that doxorubicin effectively inhibits protein synthesis, activates SAPKs, and causes apoptosis. Ribotoxic stressors share a common mechanism in that they require ZAK, an upstream MAP3K, to activate the pro-apoptotic and proinflammatory signaling pathways that lie downstream of SAPKs. By employing siRNA mediated knockdown of ZAK or administration of sorafenib and nilotinib, kinase inhibitors that have a high affinity for ZAK, we provide evidence that ZAK is required for doxorubicin-induced proinflammatory and apoptotic responses in HaCaT cells, a pseudo-normal keratinocyte cell line, but not in HeLa cells, a cancerous cell line. ZAK has two different isoforms, ZAK-α (91 kDa) and ZAK-β (51 kDa). HaCaT or HeLa cells treated with doxorubicin and immunoblotted for ZAK displayed a progressive decrease in the ZAK-α band and the appearance of ZAK-β bands of larger size. Abrogation of these changes after exposure of cells to sorafenib and nilotinib suggests that these alterations occur following stimulation of ZAK. We suggest that ZAK inhibitors such as sorafenib or nilotinib may be effective when combined with doxorubicin to treat cancer patients.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Sauter","given":"Kristin A.

Here, using ribosome footprinting, we show that 2 hr of severe heat stress triggers global pausing of translation elongation at around codon 65 on most mRNAs in both mouse and human cells. The genome-wide nature of the phenomenon, its location, and features of protein N termini suggested the involvement of ribosome-associated chaperones. After severe heat shock, Hsp70’s interactions with the translational machinery were markedly altered and its association with ribosomes was reduced. Pretreatment with mild heat stress or overexpression of Hsp70 protected cells from heat shock-induced elongation pausing, while inhibition of Hsp70 activity triggered elongation pausing without heat stress. Our findings suggest that regulation of translation elongation in general, and by chaperones in particular, represents a major component of cellular stress responses.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2013,12,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Shalgi","given":"Reut"},{"family":"Hurt","given":"Jessica A."},{"family":"Krykbaeva","given":"Irina"},{"family":"Taipale","given":"Mikko"},{"family":"Lindquist","given":"Susan"},{"family":"Burge","given":"Christopher B."}],"citation-key":"Shalgi2013","container-title":"Molecular Cell","container-title-short":"Molecular Cell","DOI":"10.1016/j.molcel.2012.11.028","ISSN":"1097-2765","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,2,7]]},"page":"439-452","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Widespread Regulation of Translation by Elongation Pausing in Heat Shock","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276512009859","volume":"49"},

We show that transgene expression (enhanced green fluorescent protein [EGFP]) from random integration sites in hESCs is affected by variegation and silencing, with only half of hESCs expressing the transgene, which is gradually lost after withdrawal of selection and differentiation. We tested the hypothesis that a transgene integrated into the adeno-associated virus type 2 (AAV2) target region on chromosome 19, known as the AAVS1 locus, would maintain transgene expression in hESCs. When we used AAV2 technology to target the AAVS1 locus, 4.16% of hESC clones achieved AAVS1-targeted integration. Targeted clones expressed Oct-4, stage-specific embryonic antigen-3 (SSEA3), and Tra-1-60 and differentiated into all three primary germ layers. EGFP expression from the AAVS1 locus showed significantly reduced variegated expression when in selection, with 90% +/- 4% of cells expressing EGFP compared with 57% +/- 32% for randomly integrated controls, and reduced tendency to undergo silencing, with 86% +/- 7% hESCs expressing EGFP 25 days after withdrawal of selection compared with 39% +/- 31% for randomly integrated clones. In addition, quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of hESCs also indicated significantly higher levels of EGFP mRNA in AAVS1-targeted clones as compared with randomly integrated clones. Transgene expression from the AAVS1 locus was shown to be stable during hESC differentiation, with more than 90% of cells expressing EGFP after 15 days of differentiation, as compared with approximately 30% for randomly integrated clones.

It remains unclear how the changing information in a growing nascent polypeptide dictates the recruitment of functionally distinct chaperones. Here, we used ribosome profiling to define the principles governing the cotranslational action of the chaperones TRiC/CCT and Hsp70/Ssb. We show that these chaperones are sequentially recruited to specific sites within domain-encoding regions of select nascent polypeptides. Hsp70 associates first, binding select sites throughout domains, whereas TRiC associates later, upon the emergence of nearly complete domains that expose an unprotected hydrophobic surface. This suggests that transient topological properties of nascent folding intermediates drive sequential chaperone association. Moreover, cotranslational recruitment of both TRiC and Hsp70 correlated with translation elongation slowdowns.

Cellular translation activity is finely tuned and proteostasis insults, such as those incurred upon viral infection, activate stress signaling pathways that result in translation reprogramming. Viral infection selectively shuts down host mRNA while redistributing ribosomes for selective translation of viral mRNAs. The intricacies of this selective ribosome shuffle from host to viral mRNAs are poorly understood. Here, we uncover a role for the ribosome associated quality control (RQC) factor ZNF598, a sensor for collided ribosomes, as a critical factor for vaccinia virus mRNA translation. Collided ribosomes are sensed by ZNF598, which ubiquitylates 40S subunit proteins uS10 and eS10 and thereby initiates RQC-dependent nascent chain degradation and ribosome recycling. We show that vaccinia infection in human cells enhances uS10 ubiquitylation indicating an increased burden on RQC pathways during viral propagation. Consistent with an increased RQC demand, we demonstrate that vaccinia virus replication is impaired in cells which either lack ZNF598 or contain a ubiquitylation deficient version of uS10. Using SILAC-based proteomics and concurrent RNAseq analysis, we determine that host translation of vaccinia virus mRNAs is compromised in cells that lack RQC activity as compared to control cells whereas there was little evidence of differences in host or viral transcription. Additionally, vaccinia virus infection resulted in a loss of cellular RQC activity, suggesting that ribosomes engaged in viral protein production recruit ZNF598 away from its function in host translation. Thus, co-option of ZNF598 by vaccinia virus plays a critical role in translational reprogramming that is needed for optimal viral propagation.</p>","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Sundaramoorthy","given":"Elayanambi"},{"family":"Ryan","given":"Andrew P."},{"family":"Fulzele","given":"Amit"},{"family":"Leonard","given":"Marilyn"},{"family":"Daugherty","given":"Matthew D."},{"family":"Bennett","given":"Eric J."}],"citation-key":"Sundaramoorthy2020","container-title":"bioRxiv","DOI":"10.1101/2020.11.12.380634","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,12]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2020, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

In the brain, the coordination among genes, or lack thereof, characterizes individual brain regions, mediates a variety of brain-related disorders, and brings light to fundamental differences between species. RNA processing, occurring between transcription and translation, controls an essential portion of gene expression through splicing, editing, localization, stability, and interference. The machinery to regulate transcripts must operate with precision serving as a blueprint for proteins and non-coding RNAs to derive their identity. Therefore, RNA processing has a broad scope of influence in the brain, as it modulates cell morphogenesis during development and underlies mechanisms behind certain neurological diseases. Here, we present these ideas through recent findings on RNA processing in development and post-developmental maturity to advance therapeutic discoveries and the collective knowledge of the RNA life cycle.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Szeto","given":"Ryan A."},{"family":"Tran","given":"Timothy"},{"family":"Truong","given":"Justin"},{"family":"Negraes","given":"Priscilla D."},{"family":"Trujillo","given":"Cleber A."}],"citation-key":"Szeto2021","collection-title":"1.

  {"id":"Tanner2009","abstract":"Several nascent peptides stall ribosomes during their own translation in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Leader peptides that induce stalling can regulate downstream gene expression. Interestingly, stalling peptides show little sequence similarity and interact with the ribosome through distinct mechanisms. To explore the scope of regulation by stalling peptides and to better understand the mechanism of stalling, we identified and characterized new examples from random libraries. We created a genetic selection that ties the life of Escherichia coli cells to stalling at a specific site. This selection relies on the natural bacterial system that rescues arrested ribosomes. We altered transfer-messenger RNA, a key component of this rescue system, to direct the completion of a necessary protein if and only if stalling occurs. We identified three classes of stalling peptides: C-terminal Pro residues, SecM-like peptides, and the novel stalling sequence FXXYXIWPP. Like the leader peptides SecM and TnaC, the FXXYXIWPP peptide induces stalling efficiently by inhibiting peptidyl transfer. The nascent peptide exit tunnel and peptidyltransferase center are implicated in this stalling event, although mutations in the ribosome affect stalling on SecM and FXXYXIWPP differently. We conclude that ribosome stalling can be caused by numerous sequences and is more common than previously believed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Tanner","given":"Douglas R."},{"family":"Cariello","given":"Daniel A."},{"family":"Woolstenhulme","given":"Christopher J."},{"family":"Broadbent","given":"Mark A."},{"family":"Buskirk","given":"Allen R."}],"citation-key":"Tanner2009","container-title":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","container-title-short":"J.

APE1 acts as a reductive activator of many transcription factors (TFs) and has also been named redox effector factor 1, Ref-1. For example, APE1 activates activator protein-1, nuclear factor kappa B, hypoxia-inducible factor 1α, paired box gene 8, signal transducer activator of transcription 3 and p53, which are involved in apoptosis, inflammation, angiogenesis and survival pathways. APE1/Ref-1 maintains cellular homeostasis (redox) via the activation of TFs that regulate various physiological processes and that crosstalk with redox balancing agents (for example, thioredoxin, catalase and superoxide dismutase) by controlling levels of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. The efficiency of APE1/Ref-1’s function(s) depends on pairwise interaction with participant protein(s), the functions regulated by APE1/Ref-1 include the BER pathway, TFs, energy metabolism, cytoskeletal elements and stress-dependent responses. Thus, APE1/Ref-1 acts as a ‘hub-protein’ that controls pathways that are important for cell survival. In this review, we will discuss APE1/Ref-1’s versatile nature in various human etiologies, including neurodegeneration, cancer, cardiovascular and other diseases that have been linked with alterations in the expression, subcellular localization and activities of APE/Ref-1. APE1/Ref-1 can be targeted for therapeutic intervention using natural plant products that modulate the expression and functions of APE1/Ref-1.

Its role in controlling cell growth and the molecular mechanisms that fine-tune its different cellular functions are still not known. By an unbiased proteomic approach, we have identified and characterized several novel APE1 partners which, unexpectedly, include a number of proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis and RNA processing. In particular, a novel interaction between nucleophosmin (NPM1) and APE1 was characterized. We observed that the 33 N-terminal residues of APE1 are required for stable interaction with the NPM1 oligomerization domain. As a consequence of the interaction with NPM1 and RNA, APE1 is localized within the nucleolus and this localization depends on cell cycle and active rRNA transcription. NPM1 stimulates APE1 endonuclease activity on abasic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) but decreases APE1 endonuclease activity on abasic single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) by masking the N-terminal region of APE1 required for stable RNA binding. In APE1-knocked-down cells, pre-rRNA synthesis and rRNA processing were not affected but inability to remove 8-hydroxyguanine-containing rRNA upon oxidative stress, impaired translation, lower intracellular protein content, and decreased cell growth rate were found.

  {"id":"Vazquez-Laslop2018","abstract":"The ribosome is a major antibiotic target. Many types of inhibitors can stop cells from growing by binding at functional centers of the ribosome and interfering with its ability to synthesize proteins. These antibiotics were usually viewed as general protein synthesis inhibitors, which indiscriminately stop translation at every codon of every mRNA, preventing the ribosome from making any protein. However, at each step of the translation cycle, the ribosome interacts with multiple ligands (mRNAs, tRNA substrates, translation factors, etc.), and as a result, the properties of the translation complex vary from codon to codon and from gene to gene. Therefore, rather than being indiscriminate inhibitors, many ribosomal antibiotics impact protein synthesis in a context-specific manner. This review presents a snapshot of the growing body of evidence that some, and possibly most, ribosome-targeting antibiotics manifest site specificity of action, which is modulated by the nature of the nascent protein, the mRNA, or the tRNAs.","author":[{"family":"Vázquez-Laslop","given":"Nora"},{"family":"Mankin","given":"Alexander S."}],"citation-key":"Vazquez-Laslop2018","container-title":"Annual Review of Microbiology","container-title-short":"Annu.

  {"id":"Veltri2022","abstract":"Key protein adapters couple translation to mRNA decay on specific classes of problematic mRNAs in eukaryotes. Slow decoding on non-optimal codons leads to codon-optimality-mediated decay (COMD) and prolonged arrest at stall sites leads to no-go decay (NGD). The identities of the decay factors underlying these processes and the mechanisms by which they respond to translational distress remain open areas of investigation. We use carefully designed reporter mRNAs to perform genetic screens and functional assays in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We characterize the roles of Hel2, Syh1, and Smy2 in coordinating translational repression and mRNA decay on NGD reporter mRNAs, finding that Syh1 and, to a lesser extent its paralog Smy2, act in a distinct pathway from Hel2. This Syh1/Smy2-mediated pathway acts as a redundant, compensatory pathway to elicit NGD when Hel2-dependent NGD is impaired. Importantly, we observe that these NGD factors are not involved in the degradation of mRNAs enriched in non-optimal codons. Further, we establish that a key factor previously implicated in COMD, Not5, contributes modestly to the degradation of an NGD-targeted mRNA. Finally, we use ribosome profiling to reveal distinct ribosomal states associated with each reporter mRNA that readily rationalize the contributions of NGD and COMD factors to degradation of these reporters. Taken together, these results provide new insight into the role of Syh1 and Smy2 in NGD and into the ribosomal states that correlate with the activation of distinct pathways targeting mRNAs for degradation in yeast.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Veltri","given":"Anthony J"},{"family":"D'Orazio","given":"Karole N"},{"family":"Lessen","given":"Laura N"},{"family":"Loll-Krippleber","given":"Raphael"},{"family":"Brown","given":"Grant W"},{"family":"Green","given":"Rachel"}],"citation-key":"Veltri2022","container-title":"eLife","DOI":"10.7554/eLife.76038","editor":[{"family":"Hinnebusch","given":"Alan G"},{"family":"Manley","given":"James L"}],"ISSN":"2050-084X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,27]]},"page":"e76038","publisher":"eLife Sciences Publications, Ltd","source":"eLife","title":"Distinct elongation stalls during translation are linked with distinct pathways for mRNA degradation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.76038","volume":"11"},

An adjacent domain in ZAKα also probes the ribosome, and together, these sensor domains are critically required for RSR activation after inhibition of both the E-site, the peptidyl transferase center (PTC), and ribotoxin action.

Ribosomal impairment is detrimental to cell function as it disrupts protein synthesis, increase inflammatory signaling and, if unresolved, lead to cell death. In this review, we offer a general overview of the three main translation surveillance pathways; the RSR, Ribosome-associated Quality Control (RQC) and the Integrated Stress Response (ISR).

  {"id":"Wang2002","abstract":"Amyloid fibrils are associated with a variety of neurodegenerative maladies including Alzheimer's disease and the prion diseases. The structures of amyloid fibrils are composed of β-strands oriented orthogonal to the fibril axis (“cross β” structure). We previously reported the design and characterization of a combinatorial library of de novo β-sheet proteins that self-assemble into fibrillar structures resembling amyloid. The libraries were designed by using a “binary code” strategy, in which the locations of polar and nonpolar residues are specified explicitly, but the identities of these residues are not specified and are varied combinatorially. The initial libraries were designed to encode proteins containing amphiphilic β-strands separated by reverse turns. Each β-strand was designed to be seven residues long, with polar (○) and nonpolar (●) amino acids arranged with an alternating periodicity (○●○●○●○). The initial design specified the identical polar/nonpolar pattern for all of the β-strands; no strand was explicitly designated to form the edges of the resulting β-sheets. With all β-strands preferring to occupy interior (as opposed to edge) locations, intermolecular oligomerization was favored, and the proteins assembled into amyloid-like fibrils. To assess whether explicit design of edge-favoring strands might tip the balance in favor of monomeric β-sheet proteins, we have now redesigned the first and/or last β-strands of several sequences from the original library. In the redesigned β-strands, the binary pattern is changed from ○●○●○●○ to ○●○K○●○ (K denotes lysine). The presence of a lysine on the nonpolar face of a β-strand should disfavor fibrillar structures because such structures would bury an uncompensated charge. The nonpolar → lysine mutations, therefore, would be expected to favor monomeric structures in which the ○●○K○●○ sequences form edge strands with the charged lysine side chain accessible to solvent. To test this hypothesis, we constructed several second generation sequences in which the central nonpolar residue of either the N-terminal β-strand or the C-terminal β-strand (or both) is changed to lysine. Characterization of the redesigned proteins shows that they form monomeric β-sheet proteins.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Weixun"},{"family":"Hecht","given":"Michael H."}],"citation-key":"Wang2002","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.052706199","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2002,3,5]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright © 2002, The National Academy of Sciences","page":"2760-2765","PMID":"11880628","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","section":"Biological Sciences","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"Rationally designed mutations convert de novo amyloid-like fibrils into monomeric β-sheet proteins","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/content/99/5/2760","volume":"99"},

  {"id":"Wei2012","abstract":"The fungal arginine attenuator peptide (AAP) is encoded by a regulatory upstream open reading frame (uORF). The AAP acts as a nascent peptide within the ribosome tunnel to stall translation in response to arginine (Arg). The effect of AAP and Arg on ribosome peptidyl transferase center (PTC) function was analyzed in Neurospora crassa and wheat germ translation extracts using the transfer of nascent AAP to puromycin as an assay. In the presence of a high concentration of Arg, the wild-type AAP inhibited PTC function, but a mutated AAP that lacked stalling activity did not. While AAP of wild-type length was most efficient at stalling ribosomes, based on toeprinting assays and reporter synthesis assays, a window of inhibitory function spanning four residues was observed at the AAP's C-terminus. The data indicate that inhibition of PTC function by the AAP in response to Arg is the basis for the AAP's function to stall ribosomes at the uORF termination codon. Arg could interfere with PTC function by inhibiting peptidyltransferase activity and/or by restricting PTC A-site accessibility. The mode of PTC inhibition appears unusual because neither specific amino acids nor a specific nascent peptide chain length was required for AAP to inhibit PTC function.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Wei","given":"Jiajie"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Cheng"},{"family":"Sachs","given":"Matthew S."}],"citation-key":"Wei2012","container-title":"Molecular and Cellular Biology","DOI":"10.1128/MCB.00136-12","ISSN":"0270-7306, 1098-5549","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,4,16]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright © 2012, American Society for Microbiology.

  {"id":"Weidensdorfer2009","abstract":"The RNA-binding protein IGF2BP1 (IGF-II mRNA binding protein 1) stabilizes the c-myc RNA by associating with the Coding Region instability Determinant (CRD). If and how other proteins cooperate with IGF2BP1 in promoting stabilization of the c-myc mRNA via the CRD remained elusive. Here, we identify various RNA-binding proteins that associate with IGF2BP1 in an RNA-dependent fashion. Four of these proteins (HNRNPU, SYNCRIP, YBX1, and DHX9) were essential to ensure stabilization of the c-myc mRNA via the CRD. These factors associate with IGF2BP1 in a CRD-dependent manner, co-distribute with IGF2BP1 in non-polysomal fractions comprising c-myc mRNA, and colocalize with IGF2BP1 in the cytoplasm. A selective shift of relative c-myc mRNA levels to the polysomal fraction is observed upon IGF2BP1 knockdown. These findings suggest that IGF2BP1 in complex with at least four proteins promotes CRD-mediated mRNA stabilization. Complex formation at the CRD presumably limits the transfer of c-myc mRNA to the polysomal fraction and subsequent translation-coupled decay.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Weidensdorfer","given":"Doreen"},{"family":"Stöhr","given":"Nadine"},{"family":"Baude","given":"Anne"},{"family":"Lederer","given":"Marcell"},{"family":"Köhn","given":"Marcel"},{"family":"Schierhorn","given":"Angelika"},{"family":"Buchmeier","given":"Sabine"},{"family":"Wahle","given":"Elmar"},{"family":"Hüttelmaier","given":"Stefan"}],"citation-key":"Weidensdorfer2009","container-title":"RNA","container-title-short":"RNA","DOI":"10.1261/rna.1175909","ISSN":"1355-8382, 1469-9001","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"104-115","PMID":"19029303","publisher":"Cold Spring Harbor Lab","source":"rnajournal.cshlp.org","title":"Control of c-myc mRNA stability by IGF2BP1-associated cytoplasmic RNPs","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://rnajournal.cshlp.org/content/15/1/104","volume":"15"},
  {"id":"Weingarten-Gabbay2019","abstract":"Despite much research, our understanding of the architecture and cis-regulatory elements of human promoters is still lacking. Here, we devised a high-throughput assay to quantify the activity of approximately 15,000 fully designed sequences that we integrated and expressed from a fixed location within the human genome. We used this method to investigate thousands of native promoters and preinitiation complex (PIC) binding regions followed by in-depth characterization of the sequence motifs underlying promoter activity, including core promoter elements and TF binding sites. We find that core promoters drive transcription mostly unidirectionally and that sequences originating from promoters exhibit stronger activity than those originating from enhancers. By testing multiple synthetic configurations of core promoter elements, we dissect the motifs that positively and negatively regulate transcription as well as the effect of their combinations and distances, including a 10-bp periodicity in the optimal distance between the TATA and the initiator. By comprehensively screening 133 TF binding sites, we find that in contrast to core promoters, TF binding sites maintain similar activity levels in both orientations, supporting a model by which divergent transcription is driven by two distinct unidirectional core promoters sharing bidirectional TF binding sites. Finally, we find a striking agreement between the effect of binding site multiplicity of individual TFs in our assay and their tendency to appear in homotypic clusters throughout the genome. Overall, our study systematically assays the elements that drive expression in core and proximal promoter regions and sheds light on organization principles of regulatory regions in the human genome.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Weingarten-Gabbay","given":"Shira"},{"family":"Nir","given":"Ronit"},{"family":"Lubliner","given":"Shai"},{"family":"Sharon","given":"Eilon"},{"family":"Kalma","given":"Yael"},{"family":"Weinberger","given":"Adina"},{"family":"Segal","given":"Eran"}],"citation-key":"Weingarten-Gabbay2019","container-title":"Genome Research","container-title-short":"Genome Res.","DOI":"10.1101/gr.236075.118","ISSN":"1088-9051, 1549-5469","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,1,8]]},"language":"en","PMID":"30622120","source":"genome.cshlp.org","title":"Systematic interrogation of human promoters","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://genome.cshlp.org/content/early/2019/01/08/gr.236075.118"},

The amyloid fibrils isolated from these different diseases share similar structural features. However, the protein sequences that assemble into these fibrils differ substantially from one disease to another. To probe the relationship between amino acid sequence and the propensity to form amyloid, we studied a combinatorial library of sequences designed de novo. All sequences in the library were designed to share an identical pattern of alternating polar and nonpolar residues, but the precise identities of these side chains were not constrained and were varied combinatorially. The resulting proteins self-assemble into large oligomers visible by electron microscopy as amyloid-like fibrils. Like natural amyloid, the de novo fibrils are composed of β-sheet secondary structure and bind the diagnostic dye, Congo red. Thus, binary patterning of polar and nonpolar residues arranged in alternating periodicity can direct protein sequences to form fibrils resembling amyloid. The model amyloid fibrils assemble and disassemble reversibly, providing a tractable system for both basic studies into the mechanisms of fibril assembly and the development of molecular therapies that interfere with this assembly.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,14]]},"author":[{"family":"West","given":"Michael W."},{"family":"Wang","given":"Weixun"},{"family":"Patterson","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"Mancias","given":"Joseph D."},{"family":"Beasley","given":"James R."},{"family":"Hecht","given":"Michael H."}],"citation-key":"West1999","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.96.20.11211","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"20","issued":{"date-parts":[[1999,9,28]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright © 1999, The National Academy of Sciences","page":"11211-11216","PMID":"10500156","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","section":"Biological Sciences","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"De novo amyloid proteins from designed combinatorial libraries","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/content/96/20/11211","volume":"96"},

  {"id":"Wisdom1991","abstract":"The stability of certain mRNAs is known to be affected by translation. Some mRNAs appear to be protected from rapid degradation by translation, whereas degradation is coupled to translation for other mRNAs. The molecular determinants of this selective effect of translation are unknown. One example of this effect is the induction of early-response gene mRNAs in the presence of translation inhibitors. To define the molecular basis of induction of early-response gene mRNA expression by inhibitors of protein synthesis, we have performed a mutational analysis of one member of the early response gene family, the c-myc gene. We find that induction by cycloheximide is due to stabilization of c-myc transcripts. The requirements for increased expression of c-myc mRNA by cycloheximide are the presence of the sequence encoding c-myc amino acids 335-439 on a mRNA that can be translated; all other portions of the c-myc gene are dispensable, and this sequence can confer induction of mRNA expression by protein synthesis inhibitors on a heterologous gene. By direct measurement of mRNA turnover in the absence of transcription-blocking drugs, we show that this sequence can function as a selective mRNA destabilizing element, that turnover mediated by this element is translation dependent, and turnover mediated by this element is inhibited by actinomycin D. Our results support the hypothesis that degradation of c-myc mRNA is coupled to translation, that the sequences specifying this form of degradation are contained in the protein-coding sequence, and that translation inhibitors induce expression of c-myc mRNA by blocking turnover mediated by this element.","author":[{"family":"Wisdom","given":"R."},{"family":"Lee","given":"W."}],"citation-key":"Wisdom1991","container-title":"Genes & Development","container-title-short":"Genes Dev.","DOI":"10.1101/gad.5.2.232","ISSN":"0890-9369","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[1991,2]]},"language":"eng","page":"232-243","PMID":"1995415","source":"PubMed","title":"The protein-coding region of c-myc mRNA contains a sequence that specifies rapid mRNA turnover and induction by protein synthesis inhibitors","type":"article-journal","volume":"5"},

  {"id":"Wu2019","abstract":"mRNA translation decodes nucleotide into amino acid sequences. However, translation has also been shown to affect mRNA stability depending on codon composition in model organisms, although universality of this mechanism remains unclear. Here, using three independent approaches to measure exogenous and endogenous mRNA decay, we define which codons are associated with stable or unstable mRNAs in human cells. We demonstrate that the regulatory information affecting mRNA stability is encoded in codons and not in nucleotides. Stabilizing codons tend to be associated with higher tRNA levels and higher charged/total tRNA ratios. While mRNAs enriched in destabilizing codons tend to possess shorter poly(A)-tails, the poly(A)-tail is not required for the codon-mediated mRNA stability. This mechanism depends on translation; however, the number of ribosome loads into a mRNA modulates the codon-mediated effects on gene expression. This work provides definitive evidence that translation strongly affects mRNA stability in a codon-dependent manner in human cells.\n          , \n            Proteins are made by joining together building blocks called amino acids into strings. The proteins are ‘translated’ from genetic sequences called mRNA molecules. These sequences can be thought of as series of ‘letters’, which are read in groups of three known as codons. Molecules called tRNAs recognize the codons and add the matching amino acids to the end of the protein. Each tRNA can recognize one or several codons, and the levels of different tRNAs inside the cell vary.\n            There are 61 codons that code for amino acids, but only 20 amino acids. This means that some codons produce the same amino acid. Despite this, there is evidence to suggest that not all of the codons that produce the same amino acid are exactly equivalent. In bacteria, yeast and zebrafish, some codons seem to make the mRNA molecule more stable, and others make it less stable. This might help the cell to control how many proteins it makes. It was not clear whether the same is true for humans.\n            To find out, Wu et al. used three separate methods to examine mRNA stability in four types of human cell. Overall, the results revealed that some codons help to stabilize the mRNA, while others make the mRNA molecule break down faster. The effect seems to depend on the supply of tRNAs that have a charged amino acid; mRNA molecules were more likely to self-destruct in cells that contained codons with low levels of the tRNA molecules.\n            Wu et al. also found that conditions in the cell can alter how strongly the codons affect mRNA stability. For example, a cell that has been infected by a virus reduces translation. Under these conditions, the identity of the codons in the mRNA has less effect on the stability of the mRNA molecule.\n            Changes to protein production happen in many diseases.

  {"id":"Xiong1995","abstract":"The tendency of a polypeptide chain to form ar-helical or ,-strand secondary structure depends upon local and nonlocal effects. Local effects reflect the intrinsic propensities of the amino acid residues for particular secondary structures, while nonlocal effects reflect the positioning of the individual residues in the context of the entire amino acid sequence. In particular, the periodicity of polar and nonpolar residues specifies whether a given sequence is consistent with amphiphilic a-helices or ,8-strands. The importance of intrinsic propensities was compared to that of polar/nonpolar periodicity by a direct competition. Synthetic peptides were designed using residues with intrinsic propensities that favored one or the other type of secondary structure. The polar/nonpolar periodicities of the peptides were designed either to be consistent with the secondary structure favored by the intrinsic propensities of the component residues or in other cases to oppose these intrinsic propensities. Characterization ofthe synthetic peptides demonstrated that in all cases the observed secondary structure correlates with the periodicity of the peptide sequence-even when this secondary structure differs from that predicted from the intrinsic propensities of the component amino acids. The observed secondary structures are concentration dependent, indicating that oligomerization ofthe amphiphilic peptides is responsible for the observed secondary structures.

  {"id":"Yang2016","abstract":"Huntington disease (HD) is a neurological disorder caused by polyglutamine expansions in mutated Huntingtin (mHtt) proteins, rendering them prone to form inclusion bodies (IB). We report that in yeast, such IB formation is a factor-dependent process subjected to age-related decline. A genome-wide, high-content imaging approach, identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase, Ltn1 of the ribosome quality control complex (RQC) as a key factor required for IB formation, ubiquitination, and detoxification of model mHtt. The failure of ltn1∆ cells to manage mHtt was traced to another RQC component, Tae2, and inappropriate control of heat shock transcription factor, Hsf1, activity. Moreover, super-resolution microscopy revealed that mHtt toxicity in RQC-deficient cells was accompanied by multiple mHtt aggregates altering actin cytoskeletal structures and retarding endocytosis. The data demonstrates that spatial sequestration of mHtt into IBs is policed by the RQC-Hsf1 regulatory system and that such compartmentalization, rather than ubiquitination, is key to mHtt detoxification.\n          , \n            Huntington’s disease is a neurological disease that is caused by mutations in the gene that encodes a protein called Htt. Individuals with this mutation gradually lose neurons as they age, resulting in declines in muscle coordination and mental abilities. The mutant Htt proteins tend to form clumps inside cells, but it is not clear if these clumps are the cause of the disease symptoms or whether they have a protective effect.\n            Yang et al. used yeast as a model to investigate whether the mutant Htt proteins need other molecules to allow them to form clumps. The experiments identified several new molecules that are required for mutated Htt to form clumps. Some of these are components of a system called the Ribosome Quality Control (RQC) complex, which monitors newly made proteins and labels abnormal ones for destruction. However, Yang et al.’s findings suggest that the RQC complex regulates the formation of Htt clumps through a different pathway involving a protein called heat shock factor 1. In this case, cells would need to fine-tune heat shock factor 1 activity to make mutant Htt proteins clump together to protect cells from damage.\n            Future experiments should expand Yang et al.’s findings to animal models of Huntington’s disease and identify which other molecules contribute to the formation of Htt clumps. One challenge will be to find out why older neurons fail to form clumps of Htt proteins, and whether this can be overcome by drugs that boost the activity of the molecules that Yang et al. identified.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Yang","given":"Junsheng"},{"family":"Hao","given":"Xinxin"},{"family":"Cao","given":"Xiuling"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Beidong"},{"family":"Nyström","given":"Thomas"}],"citation-key":"Yang2016","container-title":"eLife","DOI":"10.7554/eLife.11792","ISSN":"2050-084X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"e11792","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Spatial sequestration and detoxification of Huntingtin by the ribosome quality control complex","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://elifesciences.org/articles/11792","volume":"5"},
  {"id":"Yap2009","abstract":"The recognition of a C-terminal motif in E. coli SecM (150FXXXXWIXXXXGIRAGP166) inside the ribosome tunnel causes translation arrest, but the mechanism of recognition is unknown. Whereas single mutations in this motif impair recognition, we demonstrate that new arrest-inducing peptides can be created through remodeling of the SecM C terminus. We found that R163 is indispensable but that flanking residues that vary in number and position play an important secondary role in translation arrest. The observation that individual SecM variants showed a distinct pattern of crosslinking to ribosomal proteins suggests that each peptide adopts a unique conformation inside the tunnel. Based on the results, we propose that translation arrest occurs when the peptide conformation specified by flanking residues moves R163 into a precise intratunnel location. Our data indicate that translation arrest results from extensive communication between SecM and the tunnel and help to explain the striking diversity of arrest-inducing peptides found throughout nature.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Yap","given":"Mee-Ngan"},{"family":"Bernstein","given":"Harris D."}],"citation-key":"Yap2009","container-title":"Molecular Cell","container-title-short":"Molecular Cell","DOI":"10.1016/j.molcel.2009.04.002","ISSN":"1097-2765","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,4,24]]},"language":"en","page":"201-211","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The Plasticity of a Translation Arrest Motif Yields Insights into Nascent Polypeptide Recognition inside the Ribosome Tunnel","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276509002305","volume":"34"},

The tips of both loops contribute to the lining of the peptide exit tunnel and have been implicated in a gating mechanism that might regulate the exit of nascent peptides. Also, the extensions of L4 and L22 contact multiple domains of 23S rRNA, suggesting they might facilitate rRNA folding during ribosome assembly. To learn more about the roles of these extensions, we constructed derivatives of both proteins that lack most of their extended loops. Our analysis of ribosomes carrying L4 or L22 deletion proteins did not detect any significant difference in their sedimentation property or polysome distribution. Also, the role of L4 in autogenous control was not affected.

  {"id":"Zimmer2020","abstract":"<h3>Abstract</h3> <p>Force-sensitive arrest peptides regulate protein biosynthesis by stalling the ribosome as they are translated. Synthesis can be resumed when the nascent arrest peptide experiences a pulling force of sufficient magnitude to break the stall. Efficient stalling is dependent on the specific identity of a large number of amino acids, including amino acids which are tens of angstroms away from the peptidyl transferase center (PTC). The mechanism of force-induced restart and the role of these essential amino acids far from the PTC is currently unknown. We use hundreds of independent molecular dynamics trajectories spanning over 120 μs in combination with kinetic analysis to characterize the barriers along the force-induced restarting pathway for the arrest peptide SecM. We find that the essential amino acids far from the PTC play a major role in controlling the transduction of applied force. In successive states along the stall-breaking pathway, the applied force propagates up the nascent chain until it reaches the C-terminus of SecM and the PTC, inducing conformational changes that allow for restart of translation. A similar mechanism of force propagation through multiple states is observed in the VemP stall-breaking pathway, but secondary structure in VemP allows for heterogeneity in the order of transitions through intermediate states. Results from both arrest peptides explain how residues that are tens of angstroms away from the catalytic center of the ribosome impact stalling efficiency by mediating the response to an applied force and shielding the amino acids responsible for maintaining the stalled state of the PTC.</p><h3>Significance Statement</h3> <p>As nascent proteins are synthesized by the ribosome, their interactions with the environment can create pulling forces on the nascent protein that can be transmitted to the ribosome’s catalytic center. These forces can affect the rate and even the outcome of translation. We use simulations to characterize the pathway of force transduction along arrest peptides and discover how secondary structure in the nascent protein and its interactions with the ribosome exit tunnel impede force propagation. This explains how amino acids in arrest peptides that are tens of angstroms away from the ribosome’s catalytic center contribute to stalling, and, more broadly, suggests how structural features in the nascent protein dictate the ribosome’s ability to functionally respond to its environment.</p>","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Zimmer","given":"Matthew H."},{"family":"Niesen","given":"Michiel JM"},{"family":"Miller","given":"Thomas F."}],"citation-key":"Zimmer2020","container-title":"bioRxiv","DOI":"10.1101/2020.10.16.342899","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,16]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2020, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

  {"id":"Ziv2005","abstract":"Several experiments have suggested that newly synthesized polypeptide chains can adopt helical structures deep within the ribosome exit tunnel. We hypothesize that confinement in the roughly cylindrical tunnel can entropically stabilize α-helices. The hypothesis is validated by using theory and simulations of coarse-grained off-lattice models. The model helix, which is unstable in the bulk, is stabilized in a cylindrical cavity provided the diameter (D) of the cylinder exceeds a critical value D*. When D < D* both the helical content and the helix–coil transition temperature (Tf ) decrease abruptly. Surprisingly, we find that the stability of the α-helix depends on the number (N) of amino acid residues. Entropic stabilization, as measured by changes in Tf , increases nonlinearly as N increases. The simulation results are in quantitative agreement with a standard helix–coil theory that takes into account entropy cost of confining a polypeptide chain in a cylinder. The results of this work are in qualitative accord with most of the findings of a recent experiment in which N-dependent ribosome-induced helix stabilization of transmembrane sequences was measured by fluorescence resonance energy transfer.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Ziv","given":"Guy"},{"family":"Haran","given":"Gilad"},{"family":"Thirumalai","given":"D."}],"citation-key":"Ziv2005","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.0508234102","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"52","issued":{"date-parts":[[2005,12,27]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright © 2005, The National Academy of Sciences","page":"18956-18961","PMID":"16357202","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","section":"Biological Sciences","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"Ribosome exit tunnel can entropically stabilize α-helices","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/content/102/52/18956","volume":"102"},
